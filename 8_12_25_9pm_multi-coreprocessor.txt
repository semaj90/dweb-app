  and search for tasks like:

  - 🏗️ Go-Kratos: Build & Run
  - 🚀 NATS: Start Message Queue
  - 🚀 Full Stack: Start All Services

  check of all orchestration services on their respective ports (Kratos:8080,        
  NATS:4222, Node-Cluster:3000, QUIC:8443).

  All tasks have been set up with proper error handling, presentation settings,      
  and detailed descriptions for easy identification in VS Code's task runner.
