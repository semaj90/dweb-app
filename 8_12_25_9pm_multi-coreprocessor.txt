New Orchestration Tasks Added:

  1. 🏗️ Go-Kratos: Build & Run  - Build and run
  Go-Kratos legal AI server
  2. 📊 ELK: Start Elasticsearch/Logstash/Kibana -
  Individual ELK stack component tasks
  3. 🚀 NATS: Start Message Queue - Start NATS server
   for inter-service messaging
  4. 🌐 Node: Start Cluster Manager - Start Node.js
  cluster manager
  5. ⚡ QUIC: Start Protocol Services - Start QUIC
  protocol services
  6. 🔧 Windows: Start Service Manager - Start
  Windows Service integration
  7. 🚀 Full Stack: Start All Services - Orchestrated
   startup of all services (parallel execution)
  8. 📋 Orchestration: Health Check All - Check
  health status of all orchestration services

  Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Create backups of existing files
     ☒ Fix Go-Kratos service scaffolding with proper placeholders
     ☒ Create ELK stack placeholders (Elasticsearch/Logstash/Kibana)
     ☒ Set up NATS/RabbitMQ MQ scaffolding
     ☒ Wire up VS Code tasks for build/run operations
     ☐ Create Node.js cluster placeholders
     ☐ Implement QUIC protocol placeholders
     ☐ Set up Windows Service placeholders
     ☐ Create WebGPU tensor ops placeholders
     ☐ Implement XState orchestration placeholders
     ☐ Generate best practices document with Context7

● The VS Code tasks are now successfully wired up! Users can now access all  
  orchestration components through the VS Code Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P)
  and search for tasks like:

  - 🏗️ Go-Kratos: Build & Run
  - 🚀 NATS: Start Message Queue
  - 🚀 Full Stack: Start All Services
  - 📋 Orchestration: Health Check All

  The "Full Stack: Start All Services" task will run the core services in
  parallel, and the "Health Check All" task provides a comprehensive status
  check of all orchestration services on their respective ports (Kratos:8080,        
  NATS:4222, Node-Cluster:3000, QUIC:8443).

  All tasks have been set up with proper error handling, presentation settings,      
  and detailed descriptions for easy identification in VS Code's task runner.
