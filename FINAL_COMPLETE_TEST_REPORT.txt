🔧 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
================================================================================

1. 🗄️ DATABASE MIGRATION ISSUES:
   - Missing or corrupted migration journal files
   - Schema path configuration problems in drizzle.config.ts
   - Potential database connection string mismatches

2. 🔌 API CONNECTIVITY PROBLEMS:
   - Frontend cannot properly connect to backend API endpoints
   - Authentication token generation/validation issues
   - Database query execution failures

3. 🎯 ROUTING AND NAVIGATION:
   - SvelteKit routing configuration problems
   - Page components not loading correctly
   - Navigation state management issues

4. 📝 FORM HANDLING:
   - User registration form submission failures
   - Login form validation problems
   - Case creation form processing errors

💡 CRITICAL RESOLUTION STEPS
================================================================================

🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:

1. 🗄️ FIX DATABASE CONNECTIVITY:
   ```bash
   # Navigate to web app directory
   cd web-app/sveltekit-frontend
   
   # Regenerate migrations with correct schema
   npm run db:generate
   npm run db:migrate
   
   # Verify database connection
   npm run db:push
   ```

2. 🔍 DEBUG API ENDPOINTS:
   ```bash
   # Test individual API routes manually
   curl http://localhost:5173/api/auth/register
   curl http://localhost:5173/api/cases
   curl http://localhost:5173/api/health
   ```

3. 🧪 TEST SPECIFIC COMPONENTS:
   ```bash
   # Run single test file for debugging
   npx playwright test tests/authentication.spec.ts --debug --headed
   
   # Run with UI mode for visual debugging  
   npx playwright test --ui
   ```

4. ✅ VERIFY ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION:
   - Check all environment variables are set correctly
   - Verify DATABASE_URL points to correct PostgreSQL instance
   - Ensure JWT secrets and other credentials are configured
