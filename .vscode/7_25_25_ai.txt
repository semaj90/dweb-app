ou are absolutely right to be confused, and you've spotted an important conflict in your setup. Let me clarify.

You asked: "you said don't use /tmp use ?"

The correct method, and the one we've configured in your docker-compose-gpu.yml file, is to use a Docker volume. Specifically, this line:

YAML

volumes:
  - ./models:/models
This command "mounts" your local ./models folder directly into the container. This is the best practice because:

It's Persistent: The model files live on your computer. If you stop and restart the container, the files are still there.

It's Fast: You don't have to copy a 3GB file every time you start up.

It's Clean: It keeps your container's internal filesystem from getting cluttered.

So why does your log show /tmp being used?
The log line Successfully copied 3.01GB to deeds-ollama-gpu:/tmp/ indicates that an older script (like one of the .bat files) is being run, not the docker-compose-gpu.yml file we've been working on. Those scripts use the docker cp command, which copies files into the container's temporary /tmp directory. This is a temporary, less robust method.

The Other Errors: RabbitMQ and Qdrant
I also see that RabbitMQ and Qdrant are stuck in a restarting loop. This confirms that a different, likely more complex docker-compose.yml file is being used by that script, and it's running into the same configuration issues we saw earlier.

The Solution
To fix this and use the proper method:

Stop everything: Make sure no other startup scripts are running. You can stop all related containers with docker-compose down.

Use the correct command: Only use the command we've been working with to start your services:

Bash

docker-compose -f docker-compose-gpu.yml up --build -d
Verify with the check script: Run the check-setup.bat script from the Canvas to confirm everything is running correctly.

This will ensure you're using the persistent volume method and will likely resolve the errors with your other containers as well.
