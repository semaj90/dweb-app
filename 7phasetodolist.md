# 7-Phase Prosecutor AI Assistant Roadmap

## Phase 1: Foundation ✅ COMPLETE

- ✅ SvelteKit + TypeScript + PostgreSQL
- ✅ User authentication (prosecutor accounts)
- ✅ Basic case management CRUD
- ✅ Evidence upload system
- ✅ Docker containerization

## Phase 2: Enhanced Prosecutor UX & AI Foundations (Current)

- Bits UI v2 + Melt UI integration with prop merging
- UnoCSS with NieR/YoRHa theme, wind preset, and legacy class support
- Barrel store exports for all UI and state modules
- XState machines for prosecutor workflows (case, evidence, AI command)
- AI command parsing utilities (parseAICommand)
- Real-time UI updates via AI-controlled classes
- Cases.elements JSON object store importable anywhere
- Prosecutor can:
  - Manage many cases
  - Upload/manage evidence
  - Generate reports on persons of interest
  - Recommend prosecution
  - Manage trials

## Phase 3: Legal AI Core (LLM + Vector Search + RAG)

- Integrate LLM for legal analysis and command understanding
- Qdrant/pgvector for similarity search
- Fuse.js for fuzzy search
- RAG pipeline for legal document analysis
- AI can:
  - Analyze evidence for probable cause
  - Determine guilt based on evidence
  - Show legal precedents for similar cases
  - Highlight strongest evidence
  - Generate prosecution recommendations

## Phase 4: Data Management & Event Streaming

- Loki.js for in-memory JSON DB
- Redis for caching
- RabbitMQ for event streaming
- Neo4j for graph relationships (cases, evidence, people)
- Event service workers (Node.js) for chunking, streaming, and embedded services

## Phase 5: AI-Driven Real-Time UI Updates

- AI can update UI in real-time based on user commands
- All changes saved to backend (Postgres, Qdrant, Neo4j, etc.)
- Predictive analytics and recommendation engine

## Phase 6: Advanced AI (Self-Prompting, Recommendations)

- Self-prompting AI for workflow automation
- Personalized recommendations for prosecutors
- Conviction probability and evidence strength scoring
- Legal precedent matching

## Phase 7: Production Optimization & Deployment

- Performance tuning (LCP < 2s, API < 500ms, AI < 3s, Vector Search < 100ms, Bundle < 500KB)
- E2E testing with Playwright
- User analytics and feedback system
- Finalize documentation and deployment
