# Context7 Phase 8 Implementation Context

This document tracks the implementation status, integration notes, and best practices for the Context7 Phase 8 architecture in this workspace.

## Key Architectural Features

- **Local LLMs (Ollama, vLLM) with NVIDIA CUDA**: All AI inference and embedding are performed locally, using GPU acceleration. No remote model pulls.
- **GraphQL API Layer**: Sits atop Drizzle ORM (PostgreSQL/PGVector), Neo4j, and Redis. Exposes semantic search, reranking, and UI layout queries.
- **RAG System**: Combines PGVector for ANN, Neo4j for user path/context enrichment, Redis for session signals, and custom reranker logic.
- **Custom Reranker**: Server-only module, combines PGVector, Neo4j, Redis, and business logic for final scoring.
- **JSON UI Compiler**: Parses JSON layouts, compiles atomic CSS (UnoCSS/PostCSS/CSSNano), pushes transforms to WebGL buffers, integrates XState for state-driven updates.
- **Predictive Prefetching**: Service Worker prefetches assets based on AI predictions, using local LLM and user signals (OpenCV.js/YOLOv8).
- **WebGL2 Optimization**: Uses VAOs, buffer pooling, glsl-cubic-filter for LOD blending, gl-matrix for matrix transforms.
- **Threading**: Embedding/parsing offloaded to Web Workers, layout caching/prefetching to Service Worker, SharedArrayBuffer for efficient data sharing.
- **Error Handling**: SvelteKit error boundaries, XState guards, todo log for lost relevance/failed queries.
- **Docker Monorepo**: All services containerized with GPU support, secrets managed via .env files.

## Next Steps

1. **Implement GraphQL API Layer**: Expose semantic search, reranking, and UI layout queries.
2. **Integrate enhanced reranker with Neo4j context**: UseMemory and useReadGraph for context enrichment.
3. **Build JSON UI compiler with WebGL integration**: Parse JSON layouts, push transforms to GPU buffers.
4. **Integrate predictive prefetching and LOD caching**: Service Worker, AI assistant, matrix streaming.
5. **Add user intent tracking**: YOLOv8/OpenCV.js, pointer events, IntersectionObserver.
6. **Wire up local LLMs, PGVector, Redis, RabbitMQ**: Ensure all services use local inference and GPU acceleration.
7. **Run svelte-check and address errors**: Fix remaining SvelteKit/TypeScript issues.
8. **Log errors and lost context to todo log**: Use SvelteKit error boundaries, XState guards, and mcp-helpers.ts.

## Best Practices

- Use only local LLMs (Ollama, vLLM) with NVIDIA CUDA toolchain.
- Block outbound traffic from LLM containers to prevent remote calls.
- Use Docker monorepo for all services, with GPU passthrough.
- Integrate GraphQL API above Drizzle ORM, PGVector, Neo4j, Redis.
- Implement custom reranker as a server-only module.
- Use UnoCSS atomic CSS, scoped mode, and preset configs.
- Offload heavy tasks to Web Workers and Service Worker.
- Log errors and lost relevance to a todo log for review.

## Phase 9: Webcam Intent Tracking & Worker Integration

- Provide access to the webcam feed using browser APIs
- Transfer video frames to a dedicated Web Worker for CV model inference
- Combine results (e.g., focus coordinates) with high-frequency mouse cursor data
- Synthesize raw data into higher-level "intent signals" (e.g., INTENT_FOCUS_COMPONENT_X)
- Send intent signals to AI Prefetcher's worker and dispatch to Redis cache for server-side reranker
