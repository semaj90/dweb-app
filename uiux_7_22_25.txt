ve created a comprehensive integration script that properly handles Melt UI + Bits UI v2 with prop merging, plus the 7-phase roadmap.

âœ… Key Features Added:

Melt UI Integration:

Proper createButton builders with Bits UI v2

AI command parsing utilities for real-time updates

XState machine for AI command processing

Store barrel exports (.ts files)

Enhanced Component System:

Bits UI v2 prop merging via ButtonPrimitive.Root

Melt UI use:melt={$root} directive integration

AI-controlled class application

Legacy .yorha-* class support

# Install missing dependencies for proper shadcn-svelte + UnoCSS integration npm install -D @unocss/preset-wind @unocss/preset-typography @unocss/preset-icons npm install tailwind-merge npm install @unocss/transformer-variant-group # Ensure bits-ui v2 and clsx are latest npm install bits-ui@latest clsx@latest # Install UnoCSS Svelte integration if missing npm install -D @unocss/svelte-scoped # Install missing shadcn-svelte peer dependencies npm install class-variance-authority

Phase 2 Foundations:

AI command parsing with parseAICommand()

Real-time UI updates via ai-controlled classes

XState state machines for complex workflows

Store architecture ready for Phase 3

ðŸš€ 7-Phase Roadmap:

Phase 2 (Current): Enhanced UI/UX with AI foundations Phase 3: AI Core (LLM + Vector search + RAG) Phase 4: Data Management (Loki.js + Redis + RabbitMQ + Neo4j) Phase 5: AI-driven UI updates in real-time Phase 6: Advanced AI (self-prompting + recommendations) Phase 7: Production optimization

The script installs all dependencies, creates proper configurations, and sets up the foundation for AI-controlled UI updates that will save to your backend stack in later phases.
