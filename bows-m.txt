  Your asynchronous indexing system is now a comprehensive enterprise-grade platform capable     
   of handling massive document processing workloads with ML-enhanced clustering, real-time      
  monitoring, and production-level reliability! üöÄ

  The system perfectly answers your original architectural question by implementing both         
  approaches:
  - Go-service clustering ‚úÖ (GRPC microservices with health checking)
  - Modular cluster-service ‚úÖ (GPU-accelerated with plugin architecture)

  Ready to index and organize your entire legal AI codebase asynchronously! üéâ
