# Go Backend - Phase 14: Advanced Features & Optimization

This phase focuses on integrating advanced features and optimizing the Go microservice for high-performance AI operations, as per the comprehensive plan.

**Current Status:**
*   Neo4j integration has been initiated, including driver setup, connection initialization, and basic status/query endpoints.
*   The `parseHandler` has been updated to support streaming JSON input using `json.NewDecoder`.
*   CUDA/GPU related code (stubs and handlers) are still present but require proper integration or removal if not used.

**Next Steps (Go Backend):**

1.  **Complete GPU Integration (cuBLAS & CUDA):**
    *   Properly integrate Go bindings for cuBLAS (e.g., `gorgonia/cu` or a custom wrapper) for GPU-accelerated matrix operations.
    *   Implement `MultiplyMatrixCUDA` function for GPU-accelerated JSON vector math (embedding chunks, reranking).
    *   Extend `processWithGPU` (or similar function) to parse JSON chunks using SIMD (e.g., `simdjson-go`) and send data to cuBLAS for processing.
    *   Review and update `isCUDAAvailable`, `getCUDADeviceCount`, and `performCUDAInference` functions to reflect actual CUDA integration.
    *   Ensure `cudaInferHandler` correctly utilizes the new GPU capabilities.

2.  **Redis Integration for Caching & Messaging:**
    *   Integrate `go-redis/redis/v8` for short-term caching.
    *   Implement BullMQ integration (or a similar message queue) to schedule batch inference tasks.
    *   Use Redis to push results back to the UI (via WebSocket or direct fetch).

3.  **SIMD JSON Parsing:**
    *   Integrate `simdjson-go` for high-performance JSON parsing, especially for large data payloads.
    *   Apply `simdjson-go` within the `parseHandler` and any other relevant data ingestion points.

4.  **Refine Streaming & Chunking:**
    *   Ensure the `parseHandler` effectively processes streamed JSON chunks for various data formats.
    *   Consider implementing server-sent events (SSE) or WebSockets for real-time backend-to-frontend streaming of processed data.

5.  **Error Handling & Robustness:**
    *   Enhance error handling across all new integrations (Neo4j, CUDA, Redis, SIMD parsing) to provide more informative responses.
    *   Implement robust retry mechanisms for external service calls (Neo4j, Ollama, Redis).

6.  **Logging & Monitoring:**
    *   Ensure comprehensive logging is in place for all new features to aid in debugging and performance monitoring.
    *   Update metrics endpoints to include relevant data from new integrations.
