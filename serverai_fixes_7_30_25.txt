Use the MCP server/extension pattern: register and start servers using vscode.lm.registerMcpServerDefinitionProvider in your extension's activate function.
For agent/sub-agent orchestration (Claude, CrewAI, AutoGen, Gemini, etc.), define agent trees and hooks in your backend (Node/Python) and expose endpoints for CLI and extension calls.
Use your enhanced RAG stack and Context7 MCP extension to invoke generate_best_practices, run full-stack checks, and automate TODO/code quality generation.
Integrate with your automation scripts (npm run check, MCP tools, etc.) to keep your codebase, TODOs, and best practices up to date.
For implementation, see your mcp-helpers.ts, extension.js, and related files. Use the VS Code API samples above to scaffold extension commands, webviews, and server orchestration.

Agent Trees: Define each agent (role, goal, backstory) and which tools it may call. Use CrewAI‚Äôs Agent, Task, and Crew constructs to wire up agents and subtasks. For example:

optimizer = Agent(role="Patch Optimizer", goal="Suggest runtime tweaks", llm=llm)

            expected_output="Step-by-step plan", tools=[optimizer])
crew = Crew(agents=[architect, optimizer], tasks=[task], process="hierarchical")

CLI & Hooks: Wrap your agents in CLI tools. For instance, python ai_planner.py --task "optimize inference loop" can spawn agents in code. Use Node‚Äôs child_process or worker_threads to run these tasks concurrently if needed. CrewAI supports pre/post hooks ‚Äì e.g. logging before each agent run.

Great. I‚Äôll begin by assembling a full architecture and code scaffolding for a Node.js-based enhanced RAG backend with multi-core processing, GPU support (via Ollama or CUDA/cuBLAS), Redis caching, and sub-agent context orchestration. This will integrate with your VS Code MCP extension setup, support persistent sub-agents (Claude, Gemini, etc.), and work with a tmux/CLI loop for 24/7 agentic workflows.

I‚Äôll include Redis for caching, Qdrant or PGVector for vector memory, and provide example scaffolding for `registerMcpServerDefinitionProvider`, `worker_threads`, enhanced RAG sync logic, and Ollama integration.

I‚Äôll let you know when it‚Äôs ready.


# Local LLM-Powered VS Code Extension with Multi-Agent Orchestration

We propose a **local AI assistant** for VS Code that combines: a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server extension, multi-agent orchestration (CrewAI/AutoGen agents), a local LLM backend (Ollama + GGUF models), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with vector stores and caching, and a rich UI (SvelteKit/WebGPU). Below we outline each component in detail, citing relevant resources.

## VS Code MCP Server & Extension Setup

Use VS Code‚Äôs Model Context Protocol to bridge the editor and your AI backend. In your extension‚Äôs `activate` function, call `vscode.lm.registerMcpServerDefinitionProvider(...)` to register one or more MCP server definitions. For example:

```ts
context.subscriptions.push(vscode.lm.registerMcpServerDefinitionProvider('aiAgentServer', {
  onDidChangeMcpServerDefinitions: didChangeEmitter.event,
  provideMcpServerDefinitions: async () => [
    new vscode.McpStdioServerDefinition({
      label: 'localAiAgent',
      command: 'node',
      args: ['dist/server.js'],
      cwd: vscode.Uri.file(pathToServer).fsPath,
      env: { /* optional environment */ },
      version: '1.0.0'
    })
  ],
  resolveMcpServerDefinition: async (server) => {
    // Optionally configure API keys or settings
    return server;
  }
}));
```

This registers a local Node.js MCP server that VS Code can start. Remember to contribute `"contributes": { "mcpServerDefinitionProviders": [ { "id": "aiAgentServer", "label": "AI Agent Server" } ] }` in `package.json`. The MCP extension can then *dynamically discover tools and context*, e.g. offering different tools based on file type or user prompt. You can also provide real-time ‚Äúresources‚Äù (files or logs) to the chat: for instance, your server could update a log file in real time and VS Code will display it automatically. In practice, this lets your extension **wrap and enrich Copilot/Chat prompts**: on each chat message, your MCP server can inject extra context (instructions, tools, code snippets) before passing it to the LLM.

* **Resources & Dynamic Tools:** Use MCP resources to expose data (screenshots, compiler logs, code files) to the chat context. For example, hooking into file-save or compilation events lets you feed live context into Copilot chat threads.
* **Prompts & Commands:** Define reusable chat prompts with `server.prompt(‚Ä¶)` templates. VS Code will collect parameters from users in a dialog and invoke your server. This is ideal for ‚Äúgenerate best practices‚Äù or ‚Äúrun code quality checks‚Äù commands.
* **Authentication & Sampling:** If needed, you can request model access or other auth via MCP (beyond our scope). See VS Code docs for full MCP capabilities.

## Multi-Agent Orchestration (CrewAI, AutoGen, Claude CLI)

For complex workflows, we deploy **multiple cooperating agents**. Frameworks like *CrewAI* (Python) or *AG2/AutoGen* (Python) let you define agents with roles, goals, and tools. For example, a ‚ÄúSystem Architect‚Äù agent can outline a design, and a ‚ÄúPatch Optimizer‚Äù sub-agent can suggest low-level tweaks. Agents can form a **hierarchical or sequential task graph**: e.g. a manager agent delegates subtasks, then validates results (a CrewAI ‚Äúhierarchical‚Äù process).

* **Agent Trees:** Define each agent (role, goal, backstory) and which tools it may call. Use CrewAI‚Äôs `Agent`, `Task`, and `Crew` constructs to wire up agents and subtasks. For example:

  ```python
  from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
  architect = Agent(role="System Architect", goal="Design AI pipelines", llm=llm)
  optimizer = Agent(role="Patch Optimizer", goal="Suggest runtime tweaks", llm=llm)
  task = Task(description="Design compiler loop with vector feedback", agent=architect,
              expected_output="Step-by-step plan", tools=[optimizer])
  crew = Crew(agents=[architect, optimizer], tasks=[task], process="hierarchical")
  result = crew.run()
  ```

  This pattern lets *Claude, Gemini or local LLMs* act as individual agents. (Sources: CrewAI docs, AutoGen GitHub.)

* **CLI & Hooks:** Wrap your agents in CLI tools. For instance, `python ai_planner.py --task "optimize inference loop"` can spawn agents in code. Use Node‚Äôs `child_process` or `worker_threads` to run these tasks concurrently if needed. CrewAI supports pre/post hooks ‚Äì e.g. logging before each agent run.

* **Context & Sub-Agents:** You can also implement sub-agent calls via structured JSON tool outputs. For example, prompt Claude with a JSON schema indicating a ‚Äútool call‚Äù for the optimizer, then your code routes it to a sub-agent. This mirrors LangChain‚Äôs tool-calling (and Copilot‚Äôs function calling).

Using agents, your extension‚Äôs checks (like `npm run check`) can dynamically spawn assistants that analyze the codebase, search documentation, or fetch chatGPT recommendations. Combine this with RAG (below) so agents can retrieve relevant code snippets or design docs as needed.

## Local LLM Inference and RAG Backend

We run a **local GGUF LLM** (e.g. Llama3/Gemma3 via Ollama or llama.cpp) for privacy and speed. Ollama provides an API server for GGUF models, or you can use llama.cpp/WASM for inference. In either case, expose a REST endpoint (e.g. with FastAPI, Node.js/Express, or Rust/Axum) that accepts prompts and returns completions. Ensure your server can stream partial responses for real-time UI feedback.

To augment the LLM with project-specific knowledge, use **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. Store your project data (docs, code, logs) as embeddings in a vector database like **Qdrant** or **pgvector (Postgres)**. Upon each user query or agent action, first query the vector store for relevant context, then include that in the prompt to the LLM. As shown below, RAG retrieves related information before generation, greatly improving factuality:

&#x20;*Figure: Architecture of a RAG system. The user query is matched (via vector search) against a knowledge base (e.g. Qdrant or Redis), the top context is passed to the LLM, yielding an informed response.*

Redis can serve as a **semantic cache** layer: its vector engine lets you store embeddings and quickly retrieve similar vectors. Redis docs highlight features like *semantic caching of FAQs* to reduce LLM cost and *high-throughput in-memory search*. For example, you might cache answers to common code queries (e.g. ‚ÄúHow to fix X error?‚Äù) so future similar questions return instantly. In summary, Redis provides a fast, in-memory vector DB ideal for RAG: ‚ÄúRedis offers powerful vector management, high performance and seamless AI integration‚Ä¶ an ideal choice for enhancing generative AI with real-time data retrieval‚Äù.

Additionally, advanced techniques like self-organizing maps (SOM) can cluster embedded compiler logs or code snippets, letting agents quickly identify patterns in failures. This clustered context feeds into enhanced RAG searches. Overall, this LLM+RAG stack (Ollama+Qdrant/Redis) keeps the AI aware of your codebase and learns from it in real time.

## High-Performance Execution (Multi-Core, Rust Offload, CUDA)

To support real-time operation, parallelize and accelerate heavy tasks:

* **Node.js Concurrency:** Use the Node.js `worker_threads` module for true multithreading (shared memory) or the `cluster` module to spawn separate processes per CPU core. Worker threads are ideal for CPU-bound work (e.g. parsing logs, vector math) without blocking the event loop. For example, you can spin up one Worker per core:

  ```js
  const { Worker } = require('worker_threads');
  const cores = require('os').cpus().length;
  for (let i = 0; i < cores; i++) {
    new Worker('./heavyTask.js');
  }
  ```

  As the NodeSource guide explains, Worker Threads share memory (via SharedArrayBuffer) and let you parallelize image processing, data parsing, etc.. The older `cluster`/`child_process` APIs can also fork processes to utilize multiple cores, at the cost of higher overhead.

* **Rust/Go Native Modules:** For numerically intensive tasks (matrix ops, SOM clustering) or hard real-time work, offload to a native addon. Rust bindings like **neon** or **N-API** allow writing safe, fast Node modules. For instance, Neon‚Äôs README promises ‚Äúsafe and fast‚Äù Rust addons and NAPI-RS advertises zero-config builds with no hand-written JS glue. You could implement a CUDA-accelerated algorithm in Rust, compile to a Node module, and call it from JavaScript for speed. Similarly, Go code can be exposed via cgo. These allow heavy math (e.g. SOM, attention scoring) to run in native code while JS handles orchestration.

* **CUDA & cuBLAS Kernels:** For GPU acceleration, write custom CUDA kernels or use NVIDIA‚Äôs libraries. NVIDIA‚Äôs cuBLAS provides highly-optimized BLAS routines for matrix multiply and fused attention ops. For example, implement a fused attention operation in C++/CUDA, compile with `nvcc`, and expose it to Node/Python (via N-API or PyBind). This bypasses slower frameworks (e.g. no Triton or TensorRT needed) and targets RTX GPUs directly. (NVIDIA docs show how to create a cuBLAS handle and call GPU functions.) On the CUDA side, you can also optimize for specific precisions (FP16, BF16) to speed up inference.

* **Cache & Queue Coordination:** Use Redis or NATS as a task queue and cache. For instance, run embedding or vector queries on a GPU in a separate process, use Redis to cache results, and coordinate via a simple HTTP/WebSocket API. This keeps LLM inference responsive (send only prompts, retrieve results asynchronously).

By combining worker threads, multi-processing, and native GPU code, the backend can keep up with concurrent VS Code events (file edits, compile triggers, chat messages) without blocking.

## SvelteKit Frontend & Visualization

Build a responsive **UI (SvelteKit + WebGPU/XState)** to show what the agents are doing. For example, a custom sidebar or WebView panel can display:

* **Real-time logs & embeddings:** Show the latest compiler logs, their clustered summaries, or a heatmap of attention over code regions. These can update live via MCP resource updates.
* **Attention Graphs:** Use WebGPU to render the ‚ÄúCompiler + Attention-Aware Vector Loop‚Äù flow (see diagram). XState state machines can manage UI state as the AI iterates.
* **Patch Visualizer:** Visualize suggested code patches or TODO items created by agents, letting the user accept or refine them. (We can leverage Svelte reactivity to animate patch diffs and highlight code regions that changed.)

As a proof of concept, Roberto Butti‚Äôs SvelteKit+Ollama demo shows streaming AI responses in a web app. Similarly, your UI can stream the agent‚Äôs reasoning or patch suggestions line-by-line. Binding WebGPU shaders to attention scores could highlight code segments with high ‚ÄúAI focus.‚Äù The UI also allows direct human feedback: clicking ‚Äúapply patch‚Äù or rating suggestions can feed a real-time reinforcement signal.

## Example Workflow & Tools Integration

Putting it together, a typical flow might be: **user edits code ‚Üí compile/IR generation ‚Üí embed logs ‚Üí vector search ‚Üí agent proposes fix ‚Üí test patch ‚Üí accept/reject ‚Üí loop**. Automation hooks (npm scripts, MCP commands) can trigger these steps:

* **npm scripts:** Add tasks in `package.json`, e.g. `"check": "ts-node tools/runAgent.ts"`, so that running `npm run check` launches agents to analyze code.
* **MCP CLI:** Use the MCP CLI (via VS Code‚Äôs Chat or command palette) to invoke server prompts. For instance, `npx mcp invoke generate_best_practices` could run a predefined prompt that inspects the repo for outdated patterns.
* **SCM Hooks:** On git commit/push, spawn a background agent to create/update TODO tasks for any issues found.
* **Caching:** Use Redis for RAG caching: for each chat question or agent task, first check Redis for a cached answer or context. Store new embeddings/vectors in Redis or Qdrant for future use.

**Caching with Redis:** Redis can also serve as a fast vector cache for known queries. Its *Semantic Cache* feature looks for similar past questions and reuses answers. For example, if an agent frequently asks about ‚Äúmemory leak error X‚Äù, Redis can immediately fetch the prior resolved solution instead of re-running a full search. This greatly speeds up iterative fixes and avoids redundant LLM calls.

## Training, Evaluation & Self-Optimization

To improve the system over time:

* **Fine-Tuning:** Use LoRA/QLoRA (with tools like Unsloth) to adapt the local LLM (Gemma3/LLaMA) on your codebase. You might train on your own code and the agent‚Äôs Q\&A to make it more responsive to your style. Unsloth can merge multiple LoRA weights after training.
* **Agentic Bootstrapping:** Implement a feedback loop where agents replicate and refine themselves. For example, after an agent applies a patch and runs tests, use the results (pass/fail) as a reward signal to adjust the prompt or spawn new ‚Äúchild‚Äù agents with mutated prompts. Keep track of high-scoring fix attempts in your vector store as ‚Äúsuccessful patterns.‚Äù Over time, this yields an *autonomous RL loop* where agents propose, evaluate, and evolve their strategies.
* **User Attention Signals:** Track user interactions (e.g. which suggestions are accepted or ignored) and feed them into a reward model. This can bias the agent to favor more useful fixes.

Finally, collect metrics: compare against a benchmark (e.g. number of tests passed or static analysis scores) to validate improvements. Use your RAG-enhanced vector DB as a ‚Äúmemory‚Äù of past fixes ‚Äì similar issues can be answered by nearest-neighbor in this space.

## Summary of Technologies Used

* **Backend:** Node.js with worker threads and native modules (Rust via Neon/N-API) for concurrency; optionally Python with CrewAI/AutoGen. GPU computations via CUDA/CUBLAS.
* **Vector Stores:** Redis (in-memory vector search and cache) and Qdrant/pgvector for semantic retrieval.
* **LLM Serving:** Ollama or llama.cpp (GGUF) serving local models (e.g. Gemma3) via REST API. Tokenization via llama.cpp or HF tokenizers (no SentencePiece required).
* **UI:** SvelteKit frontend with WebGPU/WebGL for visuals, XState for state management, integrated into VS Code as WebView/sidebar via extension.
* **Extension:** VS Code MCP server (Node or Python) registered in `activate()`, handling chat tools, resources, and invoking local agents or APIs.

Each component is supported by existing tools and docs (as cited). By weaving them together ‚Äì MCP for VS Code integration, CrewAI/AutoGen for orchestration, Ollama+Qdrant/Redis for LLM+RAG, and Node.js/Rust/CUDA for performance ‚Äì you create a robust, self-improving AI assistant that stays contextually aware of your project.

**References:** Official docs and tutorials (VS Code MCP, Redis RAG, CrewAI/AutoGen, Node.js worker threads, etc.) as cited above. These cover the key design patterns for building this system.

do all 10 of these steps, create todlistlrimplement.md implement all these steps read this *.md to check your progress install everyting step by step and integrate to enhance our development on sveltekit-frontend, we'll export out the logic here to our web-app, later  
concise, actionable guide for your enhanced RAG + multi-agent VS Code MCP system, covering datastore setup, PDF/crawler improvements, UI, and best practices generation:

1. Setting Up a Datastore for Enhanced RAG
Vector Store: Use Redis (with vector search enabled) or Qdrant/pgvector for storing embeddings.

Setup: Deploy Redis with vector support (docker run -p 6379:6379 redis/redis-stack:latest) or Qdrant.
Integration: In your Node.js backend, use redis or @qdrant/js-client-rest to store and query embeddings.
Schema: Store { id, embedding, metadata, ttl } for each document/snippet.
Query: On each RAG request, embed the query, search for nearest vectors, and return top-k results.
Semantic Cache: Use Redis for fast lookup of previously answered queries (semantic cache).

2. Making the Extension Better at PDF Parsing & Crawling
PDF Parsing:

Use pdf-parse (Node.js) or pdf.js (browser) to extract text.
For VS Code, add a command: ‚ÄúImport PDF to Knowledge Base‚Äù.
Parse PDF, chunk text, embed, and store in your vector DB.
Optionally, use pdfplumber (Python) for more robust extraction (call via CLI).
Web Crawler:

Use node-crawler or puppeteer to crawl docs/websites.
Extract text, deduplicate, chunk, embed, and store.
Add a UI/CLI command: ‚ÄúCrawl URL for Knowledge Base‚Äù.
3. EnhancedRAG:Studio UI
Frontend: SvelteKit + UnoCSS + WebGPU for visualizations.
Features:

Patch visualizer (see agent suggestions, diffs, and apply/reject).
Attention heatmaps (WebGPU).
Feedback controls (rate suggestions, RL signals).
Backend: Node.js REST API (serves logs, embeddings, patch data).
Integration: Expose endpoints /api/embeddings, /api/logs, /api/patches for the UI to consume.
4. Generating Best Practices
Prompt Templates: Define ‚Äúgenerate_best_practices‚Äù as a reusable prompt in your MCP server.
Agentic Workflow: On command, agent queries codebase/docs (via RAG), summarizes patterns, and outputs actionable best practices.
Determinism: For reproducible results, set LLM temperature to 0 and use fixed seeds (if supported).
5. Real-Time Copilot/Claude/CLI Integration
MCP Server: Register with vscode.lm.registerMcpServerDefinitionProvider in your extension‚Äôs activate.

Call Logs: Store agent/LLM call logs in your vector DB for future RAG queries and auditability.
7. PDF/Crawler/Studio Integration Points
Where to Fit: PDF/crawler ingestion fits in the backend (Node.js service), triggered by UI/CLI/extension commands.
Studio UI reads from the same vector/log endpoints as the agents.
Best Practices are generated by agentic workflows, surfaced in the UI and CLI.
8. Example: Registering MCP Server in VS Code
Add "contributes": { "mcpServerDefinitionProviders": [ ... ] } to package.json.
9. Multi-Agent Orchestration
CrewAI/AutoGen: Use Python for complex agent trees, call from Node.js via CLI or REST.

phoebe.js? vs extension, get ghost suggestions to be integrated into copilot, claude code cli?
and can I generate ghost suggestions that copilot and claude code cli can read from mcp server locally? for auto-prompting?

reat. I‚Äôll begin by assembling a full architecture and code scaffolding for a Node.js-based enhanced RAG backend with multi-core processing, GPU support (via Ollama or CUDA/cuBLAS), Redis caching, and sub-agent context orchestration. This will integrate with your VS Code MCP extension setup, support persistent sub-agents (Claude, Gemini, etc.), and work with a tmux/CLI loop for 24/7 agentic workflows.

I‚Äôll include Redis for caching, Qdrant or PGVector for vector memory, and provide example scaffolding for registerMcpServerDefinitionProvider, worker_threads, enhanced RAG sync logic, and Ollama integration.

I‚Äôll let you know when it‚Äôs ready.

Enhanced Node.js RAG Server With Multi-Core, Redis, and Sub-Agent Context Integration

Local LLM-Powered VS Code Extension with Multi-Agent Orchestration
We propose a local AI assistant for VS Code that combines: a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server extension, multi-agent orchestration (CrewAI/AutoGen agents), a local LLM backend (Ollama + GGUF models), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with vector stores and caching, and a rich UI (SvelteKit/WebGPU). Below we outline each component in detail, citing relevant resources.
VS Code MCP Server & Extension Setup
Use VS Code‚Äôs Model Context Protocol to bridge the editor and your AI backend. In your extension‚Äôs activate function, call vscode.lm.registerMcpServerDefinitionProvider(...) to register one or more MCP server definitions
code.visualstudio.com
. For example:
ts
Copy
Edit
context.subscriptions.push(vscode.lm.registerMcpServerDefinitionProvider('aiAgentServer', {
  onDidChangeMcpServerDefinitions: didChangeEmitter.event,
  provideMcpServerDefinitions: async () => [
    new vscode.McpStdioServerDefinition({
      label: 'localAiAgent',
      command: 'node',
      args: ['dist/server.js'],
      cwd: vscode.Uri.file(pathToServer).fsPath,
      env: { /* optional environment */ },
      version: '1.0.0'
    })
  ],
  resolveMcpServerDefinition: async (server) => {
    // Optionally configure API keys or settings
    return server;
  }
}));
This registers a local Node.js MCP server that VS Code can start. Remember to contribute "contributes": { "mcpServerDefinitionProviders": [ { "id": "aiAgentServer", "label": "AI Agent Server" } ] } in package.json
code.visualstudio.com
. The MCP extension can then dynamically discover tools and context, e.g. offering different tools based on file type or user prompt
code.visualstudio.com
. You can also provide real-time ‚Äúresources‚Äù (files or logs) to the chat: for instance, your server could update a log file in real time and VS Code will display it automatically
code.visualstudio.com
. In practice, this lets your extension wrap and enrich Copilot/Chat prompts: on each chat message, your MCP server can inject extra context (instructions, tools, code snippets) before passing it to the LLM.
Resources & Dynamic Tools: Use MCP resources to expose data (screenshots, compiler logs, code files) to the chat context
code.visualstudio.com
. For example, hooking into file-save or compilation events lets you feed live context into Copilot chat threads.
Prompts & Commands: Define reusable chat prompts with server.prompt(‚Ä¶) templates. VS Code will collect parameters from users in a dialog and invoke your server
code.visualstudio.com
. This is ideal for ‚Äúgenerate best practices‚Äù or ‚Äúrun code quality checks‚Äù commands.
Authentication & Sampling: If needed, you can request model access or other auth via MCP (beyond our scope). See VS Code docs for full MCP capabilities
code.visualstudio.com
code.visualstudio.com
.
Multi-Agent Orchestration (CrewAI, AutoGen, Claude CLI)
For complex workflows, we deploy multiple cooperating agents. Frameworks like CrewAI (Python) or AG2/AutoGen (Python) let you define agents with roles, goals, and tools
medium.com
github.com
. For example, a ‚ÄúSystem Architect‚Äù agent can outline a design, and a ‚ÄúPatch Optimizer‚Äù sub-agent can suggest low-level tweaks. Agents can form a hierarchical or sequential task graph: e.g. a manager agent delegates subtasks, then validates results (a CrewAI ‚Äúhierarchical‚Äù process)
abvijaykumar.medium.com
.
Agent Trees: Define each agent (role, goal, backstory) and which tools it may call. Use CrewAI‚Äôs Agent, Task, and Crew constructs to wire up agents and subtasks. For example:
python
Copy
Edit
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
architect = Agent(role="System Architect", goal="Design AI pipelines", llm=llm)
optimizer = Agent(role="Patch Optimizer", goal="Suggest runtime tweaks", llm=llm)
task = Task(description="Design compiler loop with vector feedback", agent=architect,
            expected_output="Step-by-step plan", tools=[optimizer])
crew = Crew(agents=[architect, optimizer], tasks=[task], process="hierarchical")
result = crew.run()
This pattern lets Claude, Gemini or local LLMs act as individual agents. (Sources: CrewAI docs
medium.com
, AutoGen GitHub
github.com
.)
CLI & Hooks: Wrap your agents in CLI tools. For instance, python ai_planner.py --task "optimize inference loop" can spawn agents in code. Use Node‚Äôs child_process or worker_threads to run these tasks concurrently if needed. CrewAI supports pre/post hooks ‚Äì e.g. logging before each agent run.
Context & Sub-Agents: You can also implement sub-agent calls via structured JSON tool outputs. For example, prompt Claude with a JSON schema indicating a ‚Äútool call‚Äù for the optimizer, then your code routes it to a sub-agent
abvijaykumar.medium.com
github.com
. This mirrors LangChain‚Äôs tool-calling (and Copilot‚Äôs function calling).
Using agents, your extension‚Äôs checks (like npm run check) can dynamically spawn assistants that analyze the codebase, search documentation, or fetch chatGPT recommendations. Combine this with RAG (below) so agents can retrieve relevant code snippets or design docs as needed.
Local LLM Inference and RAG Backend
We run a local GGUF LLM (e.g. Llama3/Gemma3 via Ollama or llama.cpp) for privacy and speed. Ollama provides an API server for GGUF models, or you can use llama.cpp/WASM for inference
dev.to
. In either case, expose a REST endpoint (e.g. with FastAPI, Node.js/Express, or Rust/Axum) that accepts prompts and returns completions. Ensure your server can stream partial responses for real-time UI feedback. To augment the LLM with project-specific knowledge, use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Store your project data (docs, code, logs) as embeddings in a vector database like Qdrant or pgvector (Postgres). Upon each user query or agent action, first query the vector store for relevant context, then include that in the prompt to the LLM. As shown below, RAG retrieves related information before generation, greatly improving factuality
qdrant.tech
: Figure: Architecture of a RAG system. The user query is matched (via vector search) against a knowledge base (e.g. Qdrant or Redis), the top context is passed to the LLM, yielding an informed response
qdrant.tech
. Redis can serve as a semantic cache layer: its vector engine lets you store embeddings and quickly retrieve similar vectors
redis.io
. Redis docs highlight features like semantic caching of FAQs to reduce LLM cost and high-throughput in-memory search
redis.io
redis.io
. For example, you might cache answers to common code queries (e.g. ‚ÄúHow to fix X error?‚Äù) so future similar questions return instantly. In summary, Redis provides a fast, in-memory vector DB ideal for RAG: ‚ÄúRedis offers powerful vector management, high performance and seamless AI integration‚Ä¶ an ideal choice for enhancing generative AI with real-time data retrieval‚Äù

. Additionally, advanced techniques like self-organizing maps (SOM) can cluster embedded compiler logs or code snippets, letting agents quickly identify patterns in failures.
