I will now begin fixing the extensive list of errors in your SvelteKit project, starting with the most critical issues and working through them sequentially to restore functionality.

Step 1: Analyzing the Errors
Based on the npm run check output and the files you've provided, the errors can be categorized as follows:

Configuration Errors: Duplicate scripts in package.json and misconfigured PostCSS.
Dependency Issues: Missing modules like fuse.js and @tailwindcss/postcss.
Svelte 5 Migration Errors: Conflicts between <slot> and {@render} syntax.
TypeScript & Import/Export Errors: Widespread issues with module resolution, incorrect imports (default vs. named), and conflicting type declarations.
Component Prop & Style Warnings: A large number of warnings about unused CSS selectors and component props, which I will address after the critical errors.
I will now proceed with fixing these issues.

Step 2: Fixing package.json and Installing Missing Dependencies
First, I will address the duplicate script warnings in your package.json and install the missing fuse.js dependency that is causing multiple errors.

I have analyzed the extensive list of errors from your npm run check output and the provided context. The request to "fix all" is a large undertaking, so I will proceed sequentially, starting with the most critical issues that are causing cascading failures throughout the sveltekit-frontend project.

Here is a summary of the relevant files and the plan to address the errors:

1. package.json: Script and Dependency Issues
The check_output.txt file shows warnings for duplicate npm scripts and missing dependencies.

sveltekit-frontend/package.json: This file has multiple duplicate script definitions (e.g., db:reset, db:generate). It's also missing the type definitions for fuse.js, which is causing errors in multiple store files.
2. Type Definition Conflicts and Errors (src/lib/types/)
A significant number of errors originate from conflicting and missing type definitions.

sveltekit-frontend/src/lib/types/index.ts: This barrel file is re-exporting types from multiple files (api.ts, database.ts, user.ts, etc.) that have identical names (e.g., User, Case, Evidence), causing "Module has already exported a member" errors.
sveltekit-frontend/src/lib/types/user.ts, sveltekit-frontend/src/lib/types/database.ts, sveltekit-frontend/src/lib/types/api.ts: These files contain the conflicting type definitions.
sveltekit-frontend/src/hooks.server.ts: This file has a type error where the User object being assigned to event.locals.user is missing the name property, which is required by the User type definition.
3. Component and Store Errors
Numerous Svelte components and stores have errors ranging from incorrect imports to invalid syntax and type errors.

sveltekit-frontend/src/lib/components/ui/button/index.ts: The barrel export for the Button component is incorrect, leading to "has no default export" errors in every component that tries to import it.
sveltekit-frontend/src/lib/components/ui/modal/Modal.svelte and sveltekit-frontend/src/lib/components/ui/button/Button.svelte: These components violate a Svelte 5 rule by mixing the legacy <slot /> syntax with the new {@render ...} snippets.
sveltekit-frontend/src/lib/stores/saved-notes.ts, sveltekit-frontend/src/lib/stores/evidence-store.ts, sveltekit-frontend/src/lib/utils/fuzzy.ts: These files are all failing because they cannot find the fuse module or its types.
sveltekit-frontend/src/lib/stores/enhancedStateMachines.ts: This XState file has multiple issues, including redeclared variables and complex type errors related to XState v5 typings.
sveltekit-frontend/src/lib/components/AdvancedRichTextEditor.svelte: While not in the error log, you've highlighted the resizable property. This is a feature of the Tiptap table extension. I will examine this component for any related issues and ensure its implementation follows best practices.
I will now gather the contents of these files to prepare for a comprehensive fix.
