laude (Anthropic) via code/CLI with agents and sub-agents, you’ll need a structured agent orchestration setup — often using frameworks like AutoGen, CrewAI using mcp and or gemini a2a? Here's a breakdown of how to get sub-agents working (including Claude as the backend) and invoke them from code or CLI.

🧠 Core Concepts
Term	Meaning
Agent	A single Claude-powered function or persona with a specific role
Sub-agent	A helper agent triggered conditionally or as part of a task tree
CLI	Where you run commands to spawn agents, send prompts, or manage state
Hooks	Custom logic that runs before, during, or after an agent interaction (e.g., logging, patching memory, etc.)

✅ Step-by-Step Setup (for Claude with Sub-Agents)
1. Claude API Setup
You’ll need your Anthropic API key (Claude 3 models):

bash
Copy
Edit
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
Use a Python or Node wrapper like:

anthropic

langchain.chat_models.ChatAnthropic

2. Use CrewAI (Python) or LangGraph for Agent Trees
Define multiple agents and trigger them based on task steps.

Example: Agent + Sub-Agent (CrewAI)
python
Copy
Edit
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic

llm = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-sonnet-20240229")

# Define main agent
architect = Agent(
  role="System Architect",
  goal="Design AI pipelines",
  backstory="Knows local GPU, vector DB, and orchestration.",
  llm=llm
)

# Define sub-agent
optimizer = Agent(
  role="Patch Optimizer",
  goal="Suggest runtime tweaks",
  backstory="Knows FlashAttention, cuBLAS, and SOM clustering.",
  llm=llm
)

# Define task invoking sub-agent
task = Task(
  description="Design compiler loop with vector feedback",
  agent=architect,
  expected_output="A step-by-step plan",
  tools=[optimizer]
)

crew = Crew(
  agents=[architect, optimizer],
  tasks=[task],
  process="hierarchical"
)

output = crew.run()
print(output)
3. Call via CLI
Wrap the above into a CLI tool using argparse or click:

bash
Copy
Edit
python ai_planner.py --task "optimize inference loop for cuBLAS"
Or build dynamic CLI calls:

bash
Copy
Edit
# ai_cli.sh
python -c "
from my_agents import run_agent;
run_agent('$1')
"
4. Hooks (Before / After Tasks)
With CrewAI or LangGraph, you can bind custom logic:

Before/after a task (pseudo):
python
Copy
Edit
def log_hook(task, agent):
    print(f"[HOOK] {agent.role} running: {task.description}")
python
Copy
Edit
task = Task(..., pre_hook=log_hook)
5. JSON Schema for Sub-Agent Routing
If you use Claude in raw API calls or via LangChain:

Claude prompt with tool-calling stub:
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "role": "user",
  "content": "Please analyze the patch log and decide if the Optimizer should be called."
}
Response:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "tool_use": {
    "name": "PatchOptimizer",
    "arguments": {
      "logs": "patch failed due to atomic write conflict"
    }
  }
}
Then your code dynamically calls that sub-agent.

🧠 Summary: Claude + Sub-Agent Routing
What	Tool/Method
Agent definitions	CrewAI, LangGraph, AutoGen, or direct Claude API
Claude models	Use anthropic or ChatAnthropic()
Sub-agent triggers	Hierarchical task process or Claude + tool-use logic
Hooks	pre_hook, post_hook, or middleware in custom runner
CLI Control	Python CLI, shell scripts, or invoke from Node

If you need the full content of any file, a step-by-step integration guide, or code samples for a specific area (e.g., agent orchestration, CLI, VS Code extension, or best practices automation), let me kn

Use the MCP server/extension pattern: register and start servers using vscode.lm.registerMcpServerDefinitionProvider in your extension's activate function.
For agent/sub-agent orchestration (Claude, CrewAI, AutoGen, Gemini, etc.), define agent trees and hooks in your backend (Node/Python) and expose endpoints for CLI and extension calls.
Use your enhanced RAG stack and Context7 MCP extension to invoke generate_best_practices, run full-stack checks, and automate TODO/code quality generation.
Integrate with your automation scripts (npm run check, MCP tools, etc.) to keep your codebase, TODOs, and best practices up to date.
For implementation, see your mcp-helpers.ts, extension.js, and related files. Use the VS Code API samples above to scaffold extension commands, webviews, and server orchestration.

ere’s a summary and actionable plan for integrating agent/sub-agent orchestration (Claude, CrewAI, AutoGen, Gemini, Ollama, Gemma 3, etc.) with your enhanced RAG stack, Context7 MCP extension, and VS Code automation:

1. VS Code Extension: MCP Server Registration & Orchestration
Your extension’s activate function (see extension.js) already initializes the MCP server manager and registers commands for:
Context analysis
Best practices generation
Documentation lookup
Error/stack analysis
Server start/stop
To add agent/sub-agent orchestration:
Extend the MCP server manager to register endpoints for agent trees (Claude, CrewAI, etc.).
Use vscode.lm.registerMcpServerDefinitionProvider in the extension’s activation to expose new agent orchestration endpoints.
Add new commands (e.g., mcp.runAgentTree, mcp.invokeClaudeSubAgent) that call backend endpoints for agent orchestration.
2. Backend: Agent Trees, Hooks, and Endpoints
In your Node.js/Python backend:
Define agent trees (main agent + sub-agents) using CrewAI, AutoGen, or your orchestration framework.
Implement hooks (pre/post) for logging, memory patching, etc.
Expose REST/CLI endpoints for:
Running agent trees
Invoking sub-agents (Claude, Gemini, Ollama, etc.)
Returning results to the extension/CLI
3. Enhanced RAG & Context7 Integration
Use your enhanced RAG stack and Context7 MCP extension to:
Invoke generate_best_practices and other MCP tools from the extension or CLI.
Run full-stack checks and automate TODO/code quality generation.
Keep TODOs and best practices in sync with automation scripts (npm run check, MCP tools, etc.).
4. Automation & CLI Integration
Integrate with Claude code CLI, Ollama, Gemma 3, and Google CLI by:
Wrapping agent orchestration in CLI scripts (Python/Node).
Allowing the extension and CLI to trigger agent workflows and receive results.
Optionally, use the Roo Code extension or similar for further CLI/VS Code integration.
5. TODOs for Implementation

6. Documentation & Best Practices
Document all new endpoints, agent trees, and extension commands.
Use your automation to generate and update TODOs, best practices, and technical debt reports.
Cross-link results to claude.md, COPILOT_API_VALIDATION_AND_INTEGRATION.md, and other phase docs.
Would you like a code scaffold for the extension command, backend endpoint, or a sample agent tree (e.g., CrewAI or Claude sub-agent orchestration

add to npm run check and during startup of this app vs code multi-agent orchestration (CrewAI, AutoGen, Claude, LangGraph, RAG, MCP, etc.).
Use the MCP server/extension pattern: register and start servers using vscode.lm.registerMcpServerDefinitionProvider in your extension's activate function.
For agent/sub-agent orchestration (Claude, CrewAI, AutoGen, Gemini, etc.), define agent trees and hooks in your backend (Node/Python) and expose endpoints for CLI and extension calls.
Use your enhanced RAG stack and Context7 MCP extension to invoke generate_best_practices, run full-stack checks, and automate TODO/code quality generation.
Integrate with your automation scripts (npm run check, MCP tools, etc.) to keep your codebase, TODOs, and best practices up to date.
For implementation, see your mcp-helpers.ts, extension.js, and related files. Use the VS Code API samples above to scaffold extension commands, webviews, and server orchestration.

Scroll + Click	JS Event Listeners	activity_vector[]
Fix Applied	Node telemetry	reward = +1.0
