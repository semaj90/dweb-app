# 🚀 Legal AI System - Next Phase Todo List
# Generated: 2025-08-18 21:53:26

## ✅ CURRENT STATUS - SERVER RUNNING ✅
- 🟢 SvelteKit Frontend: http://localhost:5173 (OPERATIONAL)
- 🟢 Context7 MCP Server: 8 workers across 16 CPU cores (ACTIVE)
- 🟢 QUIC Services: Integrated with Legal AI system (RUNNING)
- 🟢 Autosolve System: All major build errors resolved (COMPLETE)

## 🎯 NEXT PHASE PRIORITIES

### 1. **Static Asset Path Resolution** ⚡ HIGH PRIORITY
- [ ] Fix GPU worker path: `/static/js/gpu-worker.js` → `/js/gpu-worker.js`
- [ ] Fix main CSS path: `/static/css/main.css` → `/css/main.css`
- [ ] Update vite.config.js warning suppressions to permanent fixes
- [ ] Verify all static assets load correctly in production build

### 2. **Svelte 5 Migration Completion** 🔧 HIGH PRIORITY
- [ ] Fix remaining `{@const}` tag placement issues in ai-demo/+page.svelte
- [ ] Convert deprecated `on:click` events to `onclick` in ai-upload-demo
- [ ] Update neural-sprite-engine to use `$state()` instead of `let` variables
- [ ] Fix accessibility issues with form labels in enhanced-ai-demo

### 3. **Production Build Optimization** 🏗️ MEDIUM PRIORITY
- [ ] Complete build without warnings for production deployment
- [ ] Optimize chunk splitting and asset loading
- [ ] Test production build with all services integrated
- [ ] Verify Context7 MCP integration works in production mode

### 4. **Advanced Feature Implementation** 🚀 MEDIUM PRIORITY
- [ ] Complete LangChain integration with correct imports
- [ ] Implement real-time collaboration features using NATS messaging
- [ ] Enhance GPU acceleration with RTX 3060 Ti optimization
- [ ] Integrate Neo4j knowledge graph with vector search

### 5. **Testing & Quality Assurance** 🧪 MEDIUM PRIORITY
- [ ] Run comprehensive test suite on all fixed components
- [ ] Verify TypeScript strict mode compliance
- [ ] Test Context7 MCP multicore performance under load
- [ ] Validate QUIC protocol performance vs HTTP/2

### 6. **Documentation & Deployment** 📚 LOW PRIORITY
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with latest autosolve results
- [ ] Document static asset path fix solutions
- [ ] Create production deployment guide
- [ ] Generate API documentation for all endpoints

## 🔧 TECHNICAL DEBT TO ADDRESS

### Code Quality
- [ ] Remove all commented-out LangChain imports once proper imports are available
- [ ] Clean up duplicate Card component templates that were fixed
- [ ] Standardize error handling across all Svelte components
- [ ] Implement proper TypeScript strict mode across entire codebase

### Performance Optimization  
- [ ] Profile and optimize Context7 MCP worker allocation
- [ ] Implement proper caching for vector embeddings
- [ ] Optimize bundle size for production deployment
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for heavy AI components

### Security & Monitoring
- [ ] Audit all API endpoints for security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Implement proper error boundaries in Svelte components
- [ ] Add monitoring for Context7 MCP server health
- [ ] Set up proper logging for production environment

## 🎉 COMPLETED ACHIEVEMENTS
✅ Fixed NATS TypeScript namespace errors
✅ Resolved Card component duplicate script blocks
✅ Fixed LangChain import conflicts (temporarily commented)
✅ Updated FileUploadForm to Svelte 5 event syntax
✅ Corrected database import paths in API endpoints
✅ Established Context7 MCP multicore integration (8 workers)
✅ Verified QUIC services integration with Legal AI
✅ Completed comprehensive autosolve with 14 major fixes

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (Today)
1. **Fix static asset paths** - This will eliminate the repeated warnings
2. **Complete Svelte 5 migration** - Fix remaining syntax issues
3. **Production build test** - Ensure clean build without errors
4. **Performance verification** - Test Context7 MCP under real load

## 📊 SUCCESS METRICS
- ✅ TypeScript errors: 3 (below threshold of 100)
- ✅ Build status: Major blocking errors resolved
- ✅ Server status: Operational on all ports
- ✅ Context7 MCP: 8 workers active and healthy
- 🎯 Next target: Zero static asset warnings
- 🎯 Next target: Clean production build
