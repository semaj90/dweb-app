Just wondering, but why not just make a docker container? Or multiple? To me, having a sveltekit app and an actix API should be 2 separate docker containers that you just put in a docker compose on a cheap VPS. If suddenly your business explodes you can use Kubernetes and scale easily.

Agree this setup would work too! For production use-cases, it will run in a container, but one can make the image containing only the pre-built binary instead of one with the source to build, build tools, compiler etc. + another one for the frontend.

I find elegant & simple to have a self-contained binary with everything it needs to run the whole software as an executable.

A container should only contain the things needed to run, no build tools or anything should be contained in it.

I do agree that a single binary is nice but I think that there should be some separation of concerns. Database, API, frontend, etc should be separated

 also moved to svelte for this project and its been smooth sailing so far! Its nice working with the standard web primitives instead of needing to convert them 

context-menu should allow user to add /savedcitations /savedaisummaries /saveduserreports /casesid adds to mcp context for local llm, fuse.js for search, auto-complete with local llm from our datastore. with a "find option with user query" that reads keywords and scans useractivity datastore. 

yes test all api resquests go through and attempt to use #context7 #file:mcp-context7-assistant #file:mcp-helpers.ts #sym:MCPContextAnalysis #sym:AutoMCPSuggestion  fix css sveltekit ui melt-ui bits-ui v2 #file:svelte-complete (1).txt #file:shadcn_sveltecompimporttodo.md #extensions shadcn-svelte use svelte 5 advanced setups, lightweight with our nier automata them e human computer interactions ui ux generate_best_practices #read_graph #memory Your context menu logic is already robust—just ensure endpoints and UI for "Find" are polished for a professional LLM web-app experience.
Let me know if you want a code sample for the "Find" modal/input or endpoint improvements! yes both of them, find modal/input and endpoint improvements to wire them with our setup, read docker file #codebase 

odal/input fully integrated with your context menu. This modal supports:

User query input (with Enter or Search button)
Local Fuse.js fuzzy search
Qdrant/Vector search via API
MCP/LLM autocomplete suggestions
Loading and error states
Clean, accessible UI (Svelte 5, UnoCSS, Nier Automata theme ready)
Next steps:

Ensure your /api/vector-search endpoint returns relevant results for queries.
Optionally, enhance the modal with more advanced result actions (e.g., preview, link, add to context).
Test the full stack by triggering the Find modal from the context menu and verifying all API and LLM integrations.


cachced, melt-ui builders if lazy loading pre-loaded already cachced, reads results determines if will hang ui, for seamless ux, user producitivity, they show pre-cached results via typewriter effect with a progess bar going of the background request.

figure out hwo to do this properly, json api sveltekit 2, webgl, no vdom, es do this with "high-score" read our #codebase to integrate and wire them together, then ensure api/vector-search endpoint returns relevant results for queries with "enhanced rag" #file:enhanced-rag #file:rag-api #create_relations #memory actions (e.g., preview, link, add to context).
Test the full stack by triggering the Find modal from the context menu and verifying all API and LLM integrations.
A keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+I) is now implemented to open the context menu for the first available evidence item in the current view, centered on the screen. This works in both columns and canvas modes for fast, accessible workflow.

You can further customize which evidence is targeted (e.g., last selected, hovered, etc.) as needed. Let me know if you want additional shortcuts or accessibility features!
figure out proper implementaiton of reccomendation engine from multiple services and our back-end service_workers, multi-processeed, clustered node.js wasm?

build out ai logic to process all the information
and build out ai logic to understand humans, logic, empathy, intent, best-responses. hardcoded, trained? think dating sims, ai assistants, use? fetching modules from data-stores,
selfupdating and selftraining? enhanced rag? sub agents to fix the local llm, then train the local llm by copying it, and training it, then putting eval tests to compare the two, in background processes.

This datastore is not static; it is a dynamic entity that evolves in lockstep with the neural network. As the online distillation process 

refines the model's understanding, the system will generate new or updated embeddings. These will be upserted into the vector store, ensuring that the system's long-term, retrievable memory reflects the 

most current state of its learned knowledge. This creates a complete 

learning loop: the neural network learns from recent interactions, this new knowledge is distilled and then externalized into the vector store, making it available for future retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) tasks. Frameworks like RxDB demonstrate powerful patterns for building such local-first, reactive database systems on top of backends like

postgresql and pg vector, drizzle-orm, drizzle-kit, sveltekit v2, enabling seamless data flow and state management.

we're using a gemma 3 local trained model with unsloth, add that to this setup here not sqlite or rocksdb.

using qdrant for auto-tagging, 

i need mutli-core processors, low level programming with wasm for sveltekit to manage memory optimizations possibly even vllm or the concept of vllm it's open-source yes? to work under windows 10, vs code. if it's a wasm driver, it uses a c compiler? clang. refactor this. 

sveltekit has an inverse relationship similiar to your research can we use caching loki.js? redis? rabbitmq? json stores? high vector searches defered using service_workers and under xstate time based state changes with lazy loading perhaps melt-ui builders in event of a hangup on the ui, local llm processes request determines best fit choice, i want to parse out the attention aspects of a giant local llm, gemma3 and access concurrently parallelism and reprogram cores nvidia, cuda think triton, explain how to get it to work on windows as well, open-source.  with a context switching aware smart auto-coder. if the llm learns how to program itself, and distill itself based on memory usage it can defer based on electrical signals and time, entropy physics based. 

we'll use pre-cachced responses as "lazy-loading" ui, ux screens for the web-app.

ai recommednation system.

ai behaviour recongition.

ideally the ai will recognize every element of the browser, from networking, if given permission, to hardware. and identifity best processing routes instead of just lazy loading threads with a non indexed-aware high ranking context user distlled local llm
