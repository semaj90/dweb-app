rrors from npm run check have been logged in MCP_MICROSOFT_DOCS_SEARCH_LOG.md.
The most critical errors are missing modules (e.g., @tauri-apps/api/tauri, $env/static/public, $env/dynamic/private), Drizzle ORM type mismatches, and SvelteKit/TypeScript integration issues.
Context7 & Microsoft Docs Search Results
1. Missing Module: @tauri-apps/api/tauri
No direct Context7 library found for Tauri.
Best Practice:
Install the Tauri API for Node projects:
For TypeScript types, ensure you have:
If using SvelteKit, only import Tauri APIs in code that runs in the Tauri (desktop) context, not in browser/server code.
2. SvelteKit Environment Variables
Use $env/static/public for public variables and $env/dynamic/private for private ones.
If missing, check your SvelteKit version and ensure the correct adapter is installed.
3. Drizzle ORM Type Errors
Ensure your schema matches the expected Drizzle ORM types.
Use the provided schema/queries pattern:
For type mismatches, check for renamed or missing columns/properties.
4. Bits UI & SvelteKit Integration
Use <script lang="ts"> in Svelte files for TypeScript support.
Import Bits UI components as shown in the docs.
Next Steps
Install missing dependencies (e.g., @tauri-apps/api, @types/tauri__api).
Check your Drizzle ORM schema and queries for type mismatches.
Update SvelteKit environment variable usage to match the latest best practices.
Iteratively fix errors and re-run npm run check after each change.
Would you like to start with installing missing dependencies, fixing Drizzle ORM types, or another area?- For type mismatches, check for renamed or missing columns/properties.

‚Äôs how to wire up your enhanced RAG, semantic search, analytics, and recommendations using your stack and best practices:

1. Semantic Search & Enhanced RAG (Backend)
Use your /api/search/semantic endpoint for hybrid vector search (pgvector + Qdrant).
Use the RAG pipeline (rag.js or langchain-rag.js) to retrieve and synthesize context.
For high-score recommendations, use a reranker (see PHASE8_CONTEXT7_ARCHITECTURE.md and 7_27_25aiphase8.txt for custom reranker logic).
Example:

2. Fuse.js & Loki.js for UI Recommendations
Use Fuse.js for fuzzy search and Loki.js for in-memory caching in the UI.
See fuzzy.ts for a working example.
Example:

3. Analytics & Logging
Log all user actions, queries, and errors to your analytics engine (index.js) and .md logs.
Use Svelte stores/XState for frontend analytics and state.
4. UI Integration
Connect your AI assistant UI (EnhancedAIAssistant.svelte) to /api/voice-to-text, /api/text-to-voice, and /api/search/semantic.
Use the Svelte store pattern for real-time updates and recommendations.
5. Best Practices
Use XSS protection (xss) on all user input and file uploads.
Use SSR hydration and Svelte 5 runes for state.
Use XState for orchestration and error handling.
Use Docker for all backend services (Ollama, Qdrant, Redis, Neo4j, RabbitMQ).
Log all errors and analytics events to .md files and/or your analytics DB.
Next Steps:

Integrate the above code into your assistant and search components.
Test the full flow: upload ‚Üí semantic search ‚Üí RAG synthesis ‚Üí recommendations ‚Üí analytics/logging.
If you want, I can scaffold a Svelte store and a backend endpoint for analytics logging, or show how to connect the UI to these endpoints.
Would you like a code example for the Svelte store, analytics endpoint, or a full UI-to-backend flow?
Kit/Legal AI project, synthesizing Context7 MCP, Svelte 5 runes, memory orchestration, and library documentation integration. This is based on your attached files and the latest Svelte/AI/Context7 guidance.

Context7 MCP Integration & AI Orchestration Best Practices
1. Context7 MCP Tooling Patterns
Centralize Context7 Calls: Use a single helper (see mcp-helpers.ts) to resolve library IDs, fetch docs, and call tools. Always pass relevant context (project, user intent, error state) for best results.
Error Logging: On any MCP or orchestration error, log to a dedicated .md or error tracking system (see mcpLogErrorOrContextLoss).
Memory Graph Access: Use the accessMemoryMCP pattern to query memory with both context and history, and always sort by recency or relevance.
Semantic Search: Prefer enhanced semantic search endpoints (/api/semantic/search) with context, code, and docs included. Use a threshold and limit for performance.
2. Svelte 5 Runes & Component Patterns
Use Runes for Reactivity: Always use Svelte 5 runes ($state, $derived, etc.) for state and reactivity. Declare runes with let, not const.
Component Exports: Export types in .d.ts files alongside Svelte components for TypeScript compatibility.
Module Scripts: Use <script module> for module-level logic and exports, but never export default (the default export is the component).
Scoped Styles: Use <style> blocks for component-scoped CSS. For atomic CSS, use UnoCSS with preset configs.
3. Enhanced RAG, Reranker, and Prefetching
Custom Reranker: Implement a reranker function (see your rerank example) that scores results based on user intent, context, and UI state. Augment with Neo4j path context for personalization.
Predictive Prefetching: Use a Service Worker to prefetch UI buffers and assets based on predicted user intent (from embeddings, RAG, and graph traversal).
LOD Matrix Rendering: Cache Level-of-Detail (LOD) matrices per component, and blend between LODs in shaders based on viewport focus and AI suggestions.
4. JSON UI Compiler & WebGL Integration
JSON-Driven UI: Define UI nodes as JSON, compile to UI tree, then to WebGL buffer and CSS. Use UnoCSS + PostCSS + CSSNano for dynamic style generation.
Matrix Transforms: Store and apply matrix transforms for layout and animation. Push transforms to gl.bufferData() for GPU rendering.
XState Integration: Hook UI state transitions into XState machines for robust, testable state management.
5. Multi-Agent & Memory Orchestration
Multi-Agent Analysis: Orchestrate both conversational (AutoGen) and task-based (CrewAI) agents. Aggregate and rerank their outputs.
Memory Relations: Use Context7 MCP to create and query memory relations, enabling agents to share context and learn from history.
Autonomous Engineering: Integrate autonomous engineering systems for self-healing, optimization, and next-action planning.
6. Documentation & Library Integration
Dynamic Library Docs: Use mcp-context72-get-library-docs.ts to fetch up-to-date library documentation from Context7 MCP, passing the resolved library ID and topic.
Context-Aware Docs: Enhance doc queries with current VS Code context (open files, errors, user intent) for more relevant results.
7. Error Handling & Analytics
Error Boundaries: Use Svelte error boundaries for rendering errors; log all API/orchestration errors to .md logs.
Analytics: Log all endpoint usage, errors, and recommendations for continuous improvement.
8. Performance, Security, and Threading
Web Workers: Offload embedding, parsing, and heavy computation to Web Workers. Use Service Workers for layout and asset caching.
Security: Sanitize all user input (see XSS protection in upload endpoints). Validate file types and names.
Bundle Optimization: Use cache-first strategies, TTL, and bundle splitting for optimal SSR and hydration.
Example: Context7 MCP-Driven Reranker
Summary Table
Area	Best Practice
Context7 MCP	Centralize tool calls, always pass context, log errors
Svelte 5	Use runes, type exports, module scripts, UnoCSS
RAG/Reranker	Custom scoring, Neo4j context, memory enrichment
Prefetching	Service Worker, LLM-driven, asset/UI buffer prediction
Matrix UI	JSON ‚Üí UI ‚Üí WebGL, LOD caching, XState for state
Multi-Agent	Aggregate, rerank, and synthesize agent outputs
Docs	Fetch via MCP, context-aware, always up-to-date
Error/Analytics	Log to .md, use error boundaries, track all API usage
Performance	Web/Service Workers, cache-first, SSR/hydration, security
For implementation, scaffold modules as described, use the provided helpers, and follow the above best practices for robust, AI-powered, and maintainable SvelteKit/Legal AI applications.

Bits UI + Svelte 5 Best Practices
1. Component Structure & Type Safety
Use lang="ts" in <script> for type safety.
Define prop types using Bits UI types (e.g., Accordion.RootProps) and Svelte runes like $bindable, $derived.
Always spread {...props} on custom elements inside {#snippet child({ props })} for correct behavior.
2. Styling
Atomic CSS: Use UnoCSS or Tailwind classes via the class prop for rapid, atomic styling.

<Accordion.Trigger¬†class="h-12¬†w-full¬†bg-blue-500¬†hover:bg-blue-600">Click¬†me</Accordion.Trigger>
Scoped Styles: For component-specific styles, use Svelte <style> blocks and the child snippet.
Global Styles: Import global CSS (e.g., UnoCSS base) in your root layout or entry file.

<script¬†lang="ts">¬†¬†import¬†"../app.css";¬†¬†let¬†{¬†children¬†}¬†=¬†$props();</script>{@render¬†children()}
3. Svelte 5 Runes
Use $state for local state, $bindable for two-way binding, and $derived for computed values.

let¬†value¬†=¬†$state(50);
Use bind:value, bind:open, etc., for two-way binding with Bits UI components.
4. Transitions & Animations
Use forceMount and the child snippet to apply Svelte transitions (fade, fly, slide) to Bits UI content.

<Accordion.Content¬†forceMount>¬†¬†{#snippet¬†child({¬†props,¬†open¬†})}¬†¬†¬†¬†{#if¬†open}¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†<div¬†{...props}¬†transition:slide={{¬†duration:¬†1000¬†}}>¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Content¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†</div>¬†¬†¬†¬†{/if}¬†¬†{/snippet}</Accordion.Content>
5. Reusable Components
Encapsulate Bits UI primitives in custom Svelte components for consistent API and styling.
Example: Custom MySelect, MyDialogOverlay, UserAvatar components.
6. Accessibility
Use Bits UI‚Äôs built-in accessibility features.
When customizing triggers (e.g., <div on:click>), ensure correct ARIA roles and keyboard support.
7. Pitfalls to Avoid
Always spread {...props} in custom elements inside child snippets.
For floating components (Tooltip, Dialog), maintain the required two-level structure: wrapper and inner content.
Do not style the wrapper directly; style the inner content.
8. Integration with UnoCSS/Tailwind
Use atomic classes for rapid prototyping and consistent design.
You can combine global, scoped, and atomic styles as needed.
Next Steps:

Refactor your Svelte components to use these patterns (type-safe props, runes, atomic classes).
For each UI primitive (Accordion, Tooltip, Dialog, Select, etc.), ensure transitions and state are handled as above.
Import UnoCSS/Tailwind in your global stylesheet and use their classes in your components.
Encapsulate complex logic or repeated patterns in custom Svelte components.
Would you like to see a concrete refactor of a specific component (e.g., Accordion, Tooltip, Select) using these best practices?

I want to use embed llm nomid-embed model, semantic analysis, possibly legalbert? art 1: Performance of a Gemma 3-based NLP Pipeline

You're describing a sophisticated, iterative workflow. Assuming "Gemma 3" is a hypothetical future model‚Äîsignificantly more capable and optimized than current models‚Äîwe can estimate the performance of this pipeline. The key bottleneck is not raw processing power but latency, especially in an interactive loop.

Here is a breakdown of your requested workflow and a realistic speed analysis on high-end hardware (e.g., NVIDIA H100/H200 GPU):

The Workflow, Simplified:



Ingest & Parse: Load a set of documents.

Initial RAG + Tagging/Summarization:

Retrieve (RAG): Find documents relevant to an initial query (e.g., "all witness statements related to the suspect's alibi").

Generate (LLM): For each retrieved document, tag it with keywords and create an initial summary.

User-Driven Re-ranking & Refinement:

Rank: Sort the summarized documents based on relevance to the user's current session activity and past interactions.

User Action: The user reviews the ranked list and selects a document.

Re-tag/Re-summarize: The user might ask for a more specific summary ("summarize only the timeline") or add new tags. This is another generation step.

Speed Estimation (Per Document/Interaction):



Parsing (JSON, etc.): This is CPU-bound and incredibly fast. For even large text documents, parsing is a matter of single-digit milliseconds. Negligible.

RAG - Retrieval Step: This involves creating a vector embedding of your query and searching a vector database. For a large but well-indexed database (millions of documents), this is highly optimized.

Time: 20ms - 150ms. This is often the biggest latency contributor in the pipeline.

LLM Generation (Tagging & Summarization): This is where Gemma 3's performance on a GPU is critical.

Tagging: This is a simple classification/extraction task. The model generates a few tokens. It would be extremely fast.

Time: 10ms - 50ms.

Summarization: This is more demanding as it requires generating a longer sequence of text.

Time: 150ms - 2 seconds, depending heavily on the length of the source text and the desired summary length.

Sorting & Ranking: This is a simple computational task on a small set of results.

Time: <1 millisecond. Negligible.

Total Pipeline Time for One Cycle:

For a single user interaction (e.g., running a query and getting back a ranked, summarized list of 10 documents), the total time would be dominated by the initial RAG retrieval and the parallel summarization of the 10 documents.

Estimated Total Time: ~500ms to 3 seconds.

This is fast enough to feel "instantaneous" or "interactive" for a user. The key is massive parallelism. While one document might take a second to summarize, the system can summarize 20 documents simultaneously in roughly the same amount of time by fanning the work out across the GPU's cores.

The ranking based on user.activity and last time used the app is achieved by making the initial RAG query more intelligent. The query sent to the retrieval system would be a sophisticated prompt that includes not just the user's typed words, but also context from their session, boosting the scores of documents that align with their recent focus.

Part 2: Best Practices for a Local LLM Assisting Prosecutors

This is a critical and high-stakes application where mistakes can have severe consequences. The focus must shift from pure performance to security, reliability, and auditability. Using a local LLM is the correct first step.

Here are the essential best practices for designing such a system.

1. Absolute Data Security: The Air-Gapped Environment



The entire system‚Äîhardware, software, and data‚Äîmust be 100% local and air-gapped from the public internet. No API calls to external services. This is non-negotiable to protect sensitive case information, witness identities, and investigation details.

Use strong encryption for all data at rest (on disk) and in transit (within the local network).

Implement strict, role-based access control (RBAC). Not everyone in the prosecutor's office should have access to all case data.

2. Verifiability Over Everything: Grounding with RAG



The LLM should never be allowed to answer from its own internal knowledge. This prevents "hallucinations" where the model invents facts, which would be catastrophic in a legal setting.

Every single piece of information, summary, or connection the AI generates must be directly and explicitly cited from the source material (e.g., Police Report A, Page 4, Paragraph 2, Witness Statement B, Timestamp 05:32).

The User Interface must prominently display these sources, allowing the prosecutor to instantly click and verify the original text. The AI's output is a guide, not a source of truth.

3. The AI is an Assistant, Not a Decision-Maker



The system must be designed and framed as a cognitive augmentation tool, not an oracle. Its purpose is to help the prosecutor find information faster, not to provide legal advice, suggest strategies, or assess the strength of a case.

Prohibited Tasks: The AI should be programmatically blocked from answering questions like "Is this person guilty?", "What is our chance of winning?", or "What legal strategy should we use?".

The prosecutor remains the sole decision-making authority, using the tool to build their case more efficiently.

4. Specialized, Safe Fine-Tuning



A generic LLM won't understand legal nuance. The model should be fine-tuned on a specific corpus of non-confidential legal documents: case law, legal statutes, procedural guides, and legal scholarship.

Crucially, never fine-tune the model on the confidential case data itself. This prevents "data contamination," where the model learns confidential details from one case and inadvertently leaks them when working on another.

5. Determinism and Full Auditability



Every query, every intermediate step, and every piece of generated output must be logged in a secure, immutable ledger.

This creates a complete, auditable "chain of custody" for information discovery. If a case is appealed, the defense could request a review of how the AI was used, and this log provides a transparent record.

Use model settings (like a temperature of 0) that make the output as deterministic and repeatable as possible.

6. User Interface Designed for Critical Thinking

https://chatgpt.com/c/6887f576-a498-8011-be11-634f9f45c64a#:~:text=I%20want%20to,with%20Zstd%20/%20RapidJSON

The UI should actively discourage blind trust.

Features should include: confidence scores for answers, highlighting discrepancies between witness statements, and tools for the prosecutor to easily annotate, correct, or challenge the AI's output.

By implementing these best practices, you can create a powerful tool that accelerates the legal process while upholdAnalytics (/api/analytics): A non-blocking, "fire-and-forget" fetch call logs the search event, following best practices.
