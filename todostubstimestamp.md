# TODO: Stub/Placeholder Tracking for deeds-web-app

## Timestamp: 2025-07-29

This document lists all stubbed functions, files, and service placeholders in the codebase, with notes on their purpose and integration points. Use this as a reference for future implementation and technical debt tracking.

---

## 1. Vector Service Stubs

- **Files:**
  - `src/lib/server/services/vector-service.ts`
  - `src/lib/server/services/vector.service.ts`
- **Stubbed Methods:**
  - `generateEmbedding`, `generateEmbeddingWithMetadata`, `storeEvidenceVector`, `updateEvidenceMetadata`, `deleteEvidenceVector`, `storeCaseEmbedding`, `storeChatEmbedding`, `findSimilar`, `semanticSearch`, `storeDocument`, `analyzeDocument`, `search`, `findSimilarDocuments`
- **Purpose:**
  - These stubs allow the app to compile and run without full vector DB or embedding integration. They are placeholders for Ollama, Qdrant, and pgvector-backed features.
- **Integration:**
  - Used by document upload, semantic search, and evidence/case management features. Replace with real implementations for production.

## 2. API Route Stubs

- **Files:**
  - `src/routes/api/qdrant/+server.ts`
  - `src/routes/api/enhanced-rag/+server.ts`
- **Stubbed Logic:**
  - Return static or mock data for RAG and Qdrant endpoints.
- **Purpose:**
  - Allow frontend to develop against API endpoints before backend is complete.
- **Integration:**
  - Used by document analysis, chat, and search UIs.

## 3. MCP/Agent/AI Service Stubs

- **Files:**
  - `mcp-helpers.ts` (see registry comments)
  - `COPILOT_API_VALIDATION_AND_INTEGRATION.md`, `MCP-INTEGRATION-VALIDATION-REPORT.md`
- **Stubbed Services:**
  - `autogenService`, `crewAIService`, `mcpSuggestBestPractices`, memory graph/codebase analysis
- **Purpose:**
  - Placeholder for advanced agent orchestration and best-practices suggestions.
- **Integration:**
  - Will be used for future AI workflow automation and code review features.

## 4. UI/Component Stubs

- **Files:**
  - `ENHANCED_FEATURES_TODO.md`, `BATCH_FIX_PROGRESS_SESSION_7.md`
- **Stubbed Components:**
  - Some UI elements and service APIs are stubbed for layout/testing.
- **Purpose:**
  - Allow UI to render and interact before all backend logic is ready.
- **Integration:**
  - Replace with real components/services as features are built out.

## 5. Miscellaneous/Other Stubs

- **Files:**
  - `error_summary_report.md`, `TODO_SIMPLIFIED_FILES_FOR_REENHANCEMENT.md`, `phase10nextsteps.md`
- **Purpose:**
  - Track technical debt, simplified files, and mock functions.

## [Automated Stub/TODO Detection]

This section is reserved for future automation. The goal is to automatically scan the codebase for:

- Stubbed functions (e.g., `throw new Error('Not implemented')`, `return null`, `TODO`, `FIXME` comments)
- Placeholder files and mock data
- Technical debt markers in code and documentation

**Planned Automation Steps:**

1. Use scripts or CI to grep for common stub patterns and TODOs across all source files.
2. Output results to this section or a separate report file.
3. Cross-reference with manual tracking above for completeness.
4. Update checklist and documentation automatically as stubs are resolved.

_Status: Manual tracking in place. Automation planned for future phases._

## How Stubs Relate to the App

- **Development:** Stubs unblock frontend and integration work, allowing parallel development of UI and backend.
- **Testing:** Enable end-to-end and UI tests to run without full backend.
- **Production:** All stubs should be replaced or removed before production deployment. See this file for a checklist.

## Production Readiness Checklist: Remove All Stubs

Before deploying to production, ensure the following actions are completed:

- [ ] All vector service stubs in `vector-service.ts` and `vector.service.ts` are replaced with real implementations (Ollama, Qdrant, pgvector, etc.).
- [ ] All API route stubs (e.g., `/api/qdrant`, `/api/enhanced-rag`) return real data and are fully integrated with backend services.
- [ ] All MCP/agent/AI service stubs (e.g., `autogenService`, `crewAIService`, `mcpSuggestBestPractices`) are implemented and tested.
- [ ] All UI/component stubs are replaced with production-ready components and services.
- [ ] All miscellaneous and technical debt stubs (see files listed above) are removed or implemented.
- [ ] Run `npm run check` and ensure there are no TypeScript errors or stub warnings.
- [ ] Run end-to-end and integration tests with all real services enabled.
- [ ] Review this file and confirm all items are checked off.
