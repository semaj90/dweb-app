use our local gguf with ollama, maybe llvm? langchain? postgresql, and pg vector must work together, then for rag(database of docments) for analysis,, we'll use langchain? + qdrant + postgres? + pg vector? then store them long-term based on background rabbitmq jobs using redis and subscribed ssr stores for hydation json stateless, xstate for multi-forms, for enhanced features: add autogen for multiple llm's, we'll add chroma, prisma? or just stick with our stack? , api, and or locally hosted, then we'll attempt to merge them and or seperate service workers on the javascript thread using #file:svelte-complete (1).txt best practices redis async, svelte 5 runes, use #context7 bits-ui v2, unocss, tailwind if you must for styling. #memory #create_relations #sym:## Phase 4: Data Management & Event Streaming and for our recommendation engine we'll either use pg vector or 

ai anyslis

using ai

semantic analysis, smaller ai
cpu based, on different service worker processes??? using ram and stuff? regex? and caching?
use gpu based model then switch to mini-version unless requires mr.beefy.

mr. beefy = like 6GB of gpu, which in tokens = what??? research more

grpo, 

research locally? to self-prompt, to send this over here, recomendation system.

did you mean?

"did you mean they're fcking retarded.?" 
no just more iterations.
