stgreSQL with pgvector extension remains a core part of the     
   architecture for:
  - Document metadata storage
  - Vector embeddings storage
  - RAG retrieval system
  - Legal document indexing

  The cache manager also specifically checks for and installs       
  the pgvector extension if it's missing. PostgreSQL is fully       
  integrated and wasn't removed at all!

> okay run everything for me make sure installed and do a 
  playwright, user logins in, registers and it saves to db 
  postgres everything updates crud, user has cases, cases has       
  fileupload button and we have our go-ollama based ai 
  summarizer that uploads to minio, references back to postgres     
   and pg vector and displays onto a div-modal-container 
  uploaded evidence

● I'll run the complete integration and test everything with        
  Playwright. Let me start by ensuring all services are
  properly set up and then create a comprehensive test.

yes Browser (SvelteKit 2)	LocalStorage, IndexedDB, Loki.js, Service Worker	Cache chat, embeddings, partial AI results
QUIC Proxy	Edge cache, HTTP cache	Cache common queries/responses
Backend API	Redis, In-memory cache	Cache embeddings, summarization, query results
Queue	RabbitMQ, BullMQ	Async processing, cache warming, background updates
DB Layer	Materialized views, index cache	Fast query, vector search cache
Local LLM + WebGPU	WebAssembly cache	Cache models, inference outputs locally.
 Local LLM + WebGPU inference with caching, combined with your full AI assistant use case, plus how the other caching and async pieces fit in.

1. Local LLM + WebGPU Inference with Caching: Why It’s Powerful for Low Latency
Local LLM means running a language model directly inside the user’s browser or a local machine, using frameworks like llama.cpp, Ollama, or a distilled fine-tuned legal model like gemma3-legal.

WebGPU enables using the device’s GPU (or an accelerated path on the CPU) from within the browser via WebAssembly. This lets you run inference much faster than CPU-bound JS code.

Caching inference outputs locally (in IndexedDB, memory, or via WebAssembly caches) means:

You don’t recompute the same outputs repeatedly.

If the user inputs similar prompts or queries, the cached results can be reused instantly.

Intermediate states or embeddings are stored for quick retrieval.

Result: When you press a button to chat or ask for inline edits, the AI can respond immediately without network latency, because:

The model is local (no server round-trip).

Cached partial results reduce GPU work.

You avoid bottlenecks in bandwidth or backend load.

2. User Interaction Flow in Your AI Assistant
User presses a button to start chatting.

User drags & drops files (txt, JSON, PDF, images, even videos).

These files get:

Uploaded directly to MinIO (local S3-compatible object storage).

Metadata and embeddings generated and stored in Postgres + pgvector via drizzle-orm + TypeScript.

The frontend UI is built with SvelteKit 2 + XState + stores:

XState manages UI state like "Uploading", "Processing", "Chatting", "Idle".

Async updates from backend queues (RabbitMQ or BullMQ) inform the frontend of progress.

User hits a keyboard shortcut, triggering:

AI to generate inline ghost text or suggestions in the rich text editor.

This is done via local inference or backend AI calls depending on availability and GPU load.

AI continuously:

Summarizes uploaded evidence.

Generates edits, inline suggestions.

Builds reports.

Adds new data and context to chat history (stored in Postgres JSONB with timestamps).

3. How Caching and Async Queueing Fit
Layer	Role in Your System
Browser (SvelteKit 2)	Cache chat history, embeddings, partial AI results locally (IndexedDB, localStorage, Loki.js). Keep UI responsive, minimize repeat server calls.
QUIC Proxy (optional)	Cache frequent queries/responses close to client for faster delivery (HTTP/3/QUIC).
Backend API (Redis cache)	Cache embeddings, summarizations, RAG query results for fast reuse.
Queue (RabbitMQ/BullMQ)	Run CPU/GPU-heavy tasks async: OCR, embedding, indexing, summarization without blocking UI.
DB (Postgres + Neo4j)	Store embeddings, metadata, relationships. Materialize popular queries for fast access.
Local LLM + WebGPU + WASM	Fast, GPU-accelerated local inference, caching intermediate states and outputs for instant AI responses.

4. Semantic Analysis + Distilled Models to Reduce GPU Overhead
Use a distilled, smaller legal-bert or other compact model for semantic analysis in-browser or backend:

Efficiently generate embeddings and classifications.

This reduces GPU load vs. huge full LLM runs.

Use distilled models to pre-filter or summarize, and trigger the heavier LLM only when necessary.

This approach leverages caching hits and avoids unnecessary GPU runs.

5. Streaming + Chunking + History for RAG & AI Chat
AI assistant:

Streams chunked output in real-time (e.g., partial sentences or inline edits appear as they’re generated).

Stores chat history with timestamps in DB, adding to context dynamically.

RAG enhancements:

Legal-bert does semantic search & intent clustering.

Gemma3 (fine-tuned legal LLM) synthesizes enhanced responses.

Fetch and incorporate relevant documents, cases, or even internet info if connected.

This leads to incrementally enriched, context-aware responses that improve over time.

Summary
Your architecture combines:

Local GPU-accelerated LLM inference with caching to enable instant, low-latency AI responses on the client.

Backend asynchronous pipelines to process and index uploads without blocking users.

Robust caching layers from browser to backend to optimize performance and scalability.

Semantic distilled models to reduce GPU cost by preprocessing and filtering.

Real-time UI orchestration (SvelteKit + XState) to reflect ongoing work and partial AI outputs seamlessly.

This is a modern, scalable, efficient way to build a sophisticated AI legal assistant that is responsive, context-rich, and cost-effective.
ire a QUIC/HTTP3 edge proxy with a simple in-memory cache and clarify how it fits vs a load balancer, plus how it complements your multi-layer caching and local WebGPU inference.

checklist
 QUIC proxy command that fronts rag-kratos over HTTP/3 with self-signed TLS
 Add in-memory edge cache (TTL, size, JSON-only, GET/POST-aware)
 Env wiring in .env.example
 VS Code task to build/run the proxy
 Explain QUIC proxy vs load balancer and when to use each
actions taken
Implemented QUIC proxy with edge cache
File: main.go
Reverse-proxy to RAG backend (default http://localhost:8093) over HTTP/3 with self-signed TLS.
Added in-memory edge cache:
Key: method + path + query + hash(body for POST)
TTL (QUIC_EDGE_CACHE_TTL), max items (QUIC_EDGE_CACHE_MAX), max bytes (QUIC_EDGE_CACHE_MAX_BYTES)
Caches only 200 OK JSON responses; skips SSE/Upgrade; replays headers; sets X-Cache=H3-Edge-HIT on hit.
Updated env examples
File: .env.example
Added RAG_QUIC_FRONT_PORT, RAG_BACKEND_URL, QUIC_EDGE_CACHE_*.
Added VS Code tasks
File: tasks.json
“Go: Run rag-kratos” (already added earlier).
New “Go: Run rag-quic-proxy” builds and starts the proxy.
how to run
Start rag-kratos (backend):
VS Code Task: Go: Run rag-kratos
Health: http://localhost:8093/health
Start QUIC proxy (front):
VS Code Task: Go: Run rag-quic-proxy
QUIC/HTTP3: https://localhost:8443/health
Proxies any path to the backend; caches small JSON responses for quick hits.
Optional PowerShell (if you want to run manually):

QUIC proxy vs load balancer (and where each fits)
QUIC/HTTP3 proxy (this component)

Purpose: HTTP/3 termination close to clients, multiplexing many streams over a single connection to reduce head-of-line blocking and improve mobile/lossy networks.
Adds edge caching for small JSON responses; great for repeated chat snippets, metadata calls, and vector query summaries.
Lives near the client (same machine, same LAN, or an edge node). It’s not a global traffic director by itself.
Traditional load balancer (NGINX/Envoy/Cloud LB)

Purpose: Distribute traffic across multiple backend instances, TLS termination, health checks, blue/green, rate limiting, WAF, global routing.
Can also terminate HTTP/3/QUIC and do caching, but typically sits as the primary gateway on the edge or cloud.
When to use which:

Local dev/desktop or on-prem edge: use this QUIC proxy as a lightweight H3 front and edge cache. It’s fast to start, self-contained, and optimized for your app’s paths.
Production and scaling: keep or add a real LB (Envoy, Cloud LB). You can still run this QUIC proxy on nodes as a micro-edge to further reduce latency and do path-specific caching, but the LB remains the main ingress.
where this fits your caching story
Browser: chat history, embeddings, partial results in IndexedDB/localStorage/Loki; service worker for offline reads.
QUIC edge proxy: caches small, frequent JSON responses right at the edge (client machine or close node). Cuts RTT and reduces backend load.
Backend: you already have L1 in-memory + optional L2 Redis for embeddings; can extend to summaries and RAG results.
Queue (RabbitMQ/BullMQ): async OCR, indexing, summarization; optionally warm the QUIC edge by prefetching popular keys.
DB: pgvector search with IVFFLAT indexes; materialized views for common queries; Neo4j graph enrichment for relationships.
Local LLM + WebGPU: instant client-side inference; cache WASM and model weights; combine with browser caches to return UI hints immediately, then upgrade with backend results.
next steps (optional)
Add ETag/If-None-Match between proxy and backend to avoid transferring unchanged JSON.
Add small Prometheus metrics in the proxy (edge_cache_hits/misses, bytes served).
Neo4j enrichment path:
Add NEO4J_URI/USER/PASS to env.
Add a toggle (?graph=1) in /rag that enriches results via Neo4j client and returns graph nodes/edges.
QUIC streaming routes:
If you later expose SSE-like streams over HTTP/3, adapt the proxy to bypass caching for stream content and keep flush behavior.
If you want, I can wire the Neo4j enrichment in rag-kratos with a clean response format and add a simple pgvector IVFFLAT index helper next.
