## Current Status

### Build Output

```
✓ 7,469+ modules transformed
✓ SSR and client bundles generated
✓ Output files successfully created
✓ No critical errors or warnings
```

### Warnings Remaining (Non-blocking)

- Accessibility warnings (missing aria-labels, form associations)
- Unused CSS selectors (can be cleaned up if desired)
- Component export properties marked as unused
- Some externalized modules for browser compatibility

### Performance Metrics

- Build time: ~2-3 minutes for full build
- Module processing: Fast and efficient
- Bundle size: Optimized with tree-shaking

## Next Steps

### 1. Runtime Testing (Recommended)

- Start development server: `npm run dev`
- Test all major user flows:
  - Case creation and management
  - Evidence upload and validation
  - AI chat functionality
  - Legal document management
  - User authentication

### 2. Production Deployment (Optional)

- Build for production: `npm run build`
- Deploy to hosting platform
- Configure environment variables
- Set up database connections

### 3. Accessibility Polish (Optional)

- Add missing aria-labels to buttons
- Associate form labels with controls
- Add keyboard navigation support
- Include video captions where needed

### 4. Code Cleanup (Optional)

- Remove unused CSS selectors
- Clean up unused component exports
- Optimize bundle size further
