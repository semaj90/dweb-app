# UI Export Conflicts Resolution - COMPLETE ✅

## Issue Summary

- **Problem**: Multiple exports with the same name causing build errors
  - "Card" was exported both as individual component and namespace
  - "Dialog" was exported both as individual component and namespace
  - "Textarea" was exported both as individual component and namespace
- **Error**: `plugin:vite:esbuild] Transform failed with 3 errors`

## Root Cause

Conflicting export patterns in UI component index files:

1. Individual component exports: `export { default as Card } from './Card.svelte'`
2. Namespace exports: `export * as Card from './Card/index.js'`
3. Circular reference in textarea: `export * as Textarea from './index.js'`

## Resolution

### 1. Fixed Main UI Index (`src/lib/components/ui/index.ts`)

- ✅ Removed individual `Card` export (kept namespace export)
- ✅ Removed individual `Dialog` export (kept namespace export)
- ✅ Removed individual `Textarea` export (kept namespace export)
- ✅ Added comments explaining the change

### 2. Fixed Textarea Component (`src/lib/components/ui/textarea/index.js`)

- ✅ Removed circular namespace export `export * as Textarea from './index.js'`
- ✅ Kept individual component exports for internal use

## Impact

- **Build**: ✅ No more vite/esbuild transform errors
- **Imports**: Components can still be imported via namespaces:
  - `import { Card } from '$lib/components/ui'` → Use `Card.Root`, `Card.Content`, etc.
  - `import { Dialog } from '$lib/components/ui'` → Use `Dialog.Root`, `Dialog.Content`, etc.
  - `import { Textarea } from '$lib/components/ui'` → Use `Textarea.Root`, etc.

## Status

- ✅ **RESOLVED**: The specific vite/esbuild duplicate export errors
- ⚠️ **Remaining**: Other TypeScript compilation errors (188 total) - these are separate development issues

## Next Steps

The UI component export conflicts are fully resolved. The remaining TypeScript errors are related to:

- Database schema mismatches
- Missing dependencies (openai, sharp, etc.)
- Service interface mismatches
- These don't prevent the application from running in development
