# Context7 MCP Integration Best Practices

## Server Configuration

### Port Management
- Use dedicated ports for each MCP server (40000 for Context7)
- Implement proper port conflict detection and resolution
- Use health checks to ensure server availability
- Implement graceful shutdown procedures

### Environment Configuration
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Implement proper configuration validation
- Use default values with override capabilities
- Maintain separate configurations for development and production

## Agent Integration

### Multi-Agent Coordination
- Implement proper agent initialization sequences
- Use consistent error handling across all agents
- Implement proper agent health monitoring
- Use event-driven communication patterns

### Performance Optimization
- Implement proper connection pooling
- Use caching for frequently accessed data
- Implement proper request batching where applicable
- Use streaming for large data transfers

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Graceful Degradation
- Implement fallback mechanisms for agent failures
- Use circuit breaker patterns for external services
- Implement proper retry logic with exponential backoff
- Maintain service availability during partial failures

### Monitoring and Alerting
- Implement comprehensive logging for debugging
- Use structured logging with correlation IDs
- Implement proper metrics collection and monitoring
- Set up alerting for critical failures

## Security Considerations

### API Security
- Use proper authentication and authorization
- Implement rate limiting and throttling
- Use input validation and sanitization
- Implement proper CORS policies

### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Implement proper access controls
- Use secure communication protocols
- Maintain audit trails for sensitive operations

## Development Best Practices

### Code Organization
- Use modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use consistent coding standards and formatting
- Implement proper documentation and comments

### Testing Strategies
- Use unit tests for individual components
- Implement integration tests for MCP communication
- Use end-to-end tests for critical workflows
- Implement performance and load testing

### Deployment and Operations
- Use containerization for consistent deployments
- Implement proper CI/CD pipelines
- Use infrastructure as code practices
- Implement proper monitoring and observability
