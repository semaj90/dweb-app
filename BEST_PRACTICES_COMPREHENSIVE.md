## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### Database Security
- Use strong passwords (16+ characters with mixed case, numbers, symbols)
- Enable SSL/TLS for database connections
- Implement connection pooling with limits
- Regular security audits and updates
- Backup encryption with rotation

### API Security
- JWT tokens with short expiration (1 hour)
- Rate limiting: 100 requests/minute per IP
- Input validation and sanitization
- CORS configuration for specific origins
- API key rotation every 90 days

### File Upload Security
- Virus scanning before storage
- File type validation (whitelist)
- Size limits: 50MB per file, 500MB per session
- Quarantine suspicious files
- Audit trail for all uploads

## ⚡ Performance Best Practices

### Database Optimization
- Index all foreign keys and search columns
- Use prepared statements for all queries
- Connection pooling: min 5, max 25 connections
- Query timeout: 30 seconds
- Regular VACUUM and ANALYZE

### Caching Strategy
- Redis for session data (TTL: 1 hour)
- Qdrant for vector embeddings (persistent)
- Application cache for API responses (TTL: 5 minutes)
- CDN for static assets
- Browser caching headers

### Memory Management
- Go service: 2GB heap limit
- Node.js: 4GB max old space
- PostgreSQL: 25% of system RAM
- Redis: 1GB max memory
- Monitor memory usage continuously

## 🧠 AI/ML Best Practices

### Model Selection
- Use quantized models (Q4_K_M) for production
- Fallback chain: Local LLM → Claude → OpenAI
- Context window optimization (4K chunks)
- Embedding dimension: 384 for balance
- Model warm-up on service start

### Vector Search
- Cosine similarity for semantic search
- HNSW index for fast nearest neighbor
- Batch processing for bulk operations
- Result caching for common queries
- Relevance scoring threshold: 0.7

### Data Processing
- Chunk documents at sentence boundaries
- Metadata extraction for filtering
- Parallel processing with worker threads
- Error handling with graceful degradation
- Progress tracking for long operations

## 🚀 Development Best Practices

### SvelteKit 2 + Svelte 5
- Use `$state()` for reactive variables
- Use `$derived()` for computed values
- Use `$effect()` for side effects
- Progressive enhancement with use:enhance
- Type safety with generated types

### Go Microservices
- Structured logging with levels
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Health check endpoints
- Circuit breaker pattern
- Metrics collection (Prometheus)

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: 80% coverage minimum
- Integration tests for APIs
- End-to-end tests for critical paths
- Performance tests under load
- Security penetration testing

## 📊 Monitoring Best Practices

### Metrics Collection
- Response times (p50, p95, p99)
- Error rates by endpoint
- Database connection pool usage
- Memory and CPU utilization
- Cache hit/miss ratios

### Alerting Rules
- Response time > 5 seconds
- Error rate > 5%
- Database connections > 80%
- Memory usage > 85%
- Disk space < 10% free

### Log Management
- Structured logging (JSON format)
- Log levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR
- Centralized log aggregation
- Log retention: 30 days
- PII redaction in logs

## 🔄 Backup & Recovery

### Database Backups
- Daily full backups at 2 AM
- Hourly incremental backups
- Weekly backup verification
- 30-day retention policy
- Encrypted backup storage

### File Storage Backups
- Real-time replication to secondary storage
- Daily integrity checks
- Geo-redundant storage
- Point-in-time recovery capability
- Automated restore testing
