# Phase-by-Phase Stub, TODO, and Technical Debt Tracking

## Purpose

This document summarizes all code stubs, TODOs, and technical debt in the deeds-web-app project, organized by development phase. Use this as a living checklist for tracking progress, planning, and ensuring production readiness.

---

## Phase 1: Vector Service Integration

- **Stubs:**
  - `src/lib/server/services/vector-service.ts`, `vector.service.ts`: All vector DB/embedding methods stubbed (see `todostubstimestamp.md`).
- **TODOs:**
  - Implement real vector DB (Ollama, Qdrant, pgvector) logic.
  - Integrate with document upload, semantic search, and evidence/case management.
- **Technical Debt:**
  - Placeholder logic blocks UI/backend integration.

## Phase 2: API Route Development

- **Stubs:**
  - `src/routes/api/qdrant/+server.ts`, `src/routes/api/enhanced-rag/+server.ts`: Return static/mock data.
- **TODOs:**
  - Connect endpoints to real backend services.
  - Remove static/mock responses.
- **Technical Debt:**
  - API contract may drift from backend reality if not updated.

## Phase 3: MCP/Agent/AI Service Orchestration

- **Stubs:**
  - `mcp-helpers.ts`, `COPILOT_API_VALIDATION_AND_INTEGRATION.md`, `MCP-INTEGRATION-VALIDATION-REPORT.md`: Agent/AI service placeholders.
- **TODOs:**
  - Implement `autogenService`, `crewAIService`, `mcpSuggestBestPractices`.
  - Integrate memory graph/codebase analysis.
- **Technical Debt:**
  - Advanced agent features blocked by stubs.

## Phase 4: UI/Component Completion

- **Stubs:**
  - `ENHANCED_FEATURES_TODO.md`, `BATCH_FIX_PROGRESS_SESSION_7.md`: UI/component placeholders.
- **TODOs:**
  - Replace stubbed UI elements and service APIs with real implementations.
- **Technical Debt:**
  - UI may not reflect final backend/API structure.

## Phase 5: Miscellaneous/Other

- **Stubs:**
  - `error_summary_report.md`, `TODO_SIMPLIFIED_FILES_FOR_REENHANCEMENT.md`, `phase10nextsteps.md`: Technical debt, simplified files, mock functions.
- **TODOs:**
  - Review and resolve all technical debt and mock logic.
- **Technical Debt:**
  - Accumulated debt may impact maintainability and production readiness.

## Automation & Checklist

- Consider automating stub/TODO detection and checklist generation for future phases.
- Regularly update this file and `todostubstimestamp.md` as stubs are removed or implemented.

---

## Production Readiness (Summary)

- All stubs and placeholders must be removed or replaced before production.
- See `todostubstimestamp.md` for a detailed checklist.
