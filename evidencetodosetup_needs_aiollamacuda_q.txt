yes and create evidencetodo.md o achieve a fully editable, searchable, and interactive legal evidence system—where evidence/docs are uploaded, edited, searched, and visualized as nodes (e.g., on a canvas), and all changes are saved and connected to users/cases—you should combine several technologies and patterns from your stack:

1. Storage & Search Layer
pgvector (Postgres + Drizzle ORM): Store evidence metadata, user/case links, and vector embeddings for semantic search.
Qdrant: For advanced vector/semantic search and similarity (e.g., “find docs like this”).
Fuse.js/Loki.js: For fast, client-side fuzzy search/filtering in the UI.
Neo4j: If you want to model complex relationships (evidence <-> user <-> case <-> report) as a graph.
Redis: For caching, fast lookups, or pub/sub notifications.
RabbitMQ: For async processing (e.g., virus scan, OCR, AI enrichment after upload).
2. API Layer
REST (AJAX/JSON): For standard CRUD (upload, edit, list, delete evidence).
GraphQL: For flexible queries (e.g., fetch all evidence for a user, with related cases, nodes, etc.).
WebSocket: For real-time updates (e.g., when evidence is edited or added).
3. Editable Evidence & Node System
XState: Use state machines to manage evidence upload, edit, and node interactions (ensures robust, predictable UI logic).
Drizzle ORM: For all DB operations (create, update, delete, link evidence to users/cases).
AJAX/Fetch: For all client-server communication (REST or GraphQL).
Interactive Canvas: Import evidence as nodes, allow drag/drop, connect nodes, and save relationships.
4. Example: Editable Evidence Flow
a. Upload Evidence (REST/GraphQL)
POST /api/users/:userId/evidence (multipart/form-data)
Save file, metadata, and generate embedding (store in pgvector/Qdrant).
b. Edit Evidence
PATCH /api/users/:userId/evidence/:evidenceId
Update metadata, re-embed if content changes.
c. List/Search Evidence
GET /api/users/:userId/evidence (list all)
POST /api/users/:userId/evidence/search (semantic search, Qdrant/pgvector)
Fuzzy search in UI with Fuse.js.
d. Canvas Integration
Evidence/docs are nodes.
User can import evidence to canvas, connect nodes (e.g., evidence to case, report, person).
Save node positions and relationships (Drizzle/Neo4j).
e. XState Example (Evidence Upload/Edit)
5. Connections & Memory
Use a graph DB (Neo4j) or relational tables (Drizzle/Postgres) to store relationships (evidence <-> case <-> user <-> report).
Use Context7 MCP and your enhanced index to remember and retrieve these connections for AI and search.
6. File/Codebase Integration
Place API endpoints in src/routes/api/evidence/+server.ts (REST) or src/routes/api/graphql/+server.ts (GraphQL).
Use Svelte stores/XState for frontend state.
Use Drizzle ORM for all DB access.
Use Qdrant/pgvector for semantic search.
Use Fuse.js for instant UI search.
Use your canvas component to visualize and edit nodes.
7. Example: Evidence Node Save (AJAX)
Summary:

Use Drizzle/pgvector/Qdrant for storage and semantic search.
Use XState for robust UI state.
Use REST/GraphQL for API.
Use Neo4j or relational tables for connections.
Use Fuse.js for UI search.
Use your canvas for node editing and visualization.
All changes are saved and connected, and the system can “remember” and retrieve these via enhanced index and Context7.

# Evidence System TODO

## Goal

Build a fully editable, searchable, and interactive legal evidence system:

- Evidence/docs are uploaded, edited, searched, and visualized as nodes (canvas).
- All changes are saved and connected to users/cases.
- System supports semantic, fuzzy, and relationship search.

---

## 1. Storage & Search Layer

- **pgvector (Postgres + Drizzle ORM):** Store evidence metadata, user/case links, vector embeddings.
- **Qdrant:** Advanced vector/semantic search and similarity.
- **Fuse.js/Loki.js:** Fast, client-side fuzzy search/filtering in UI.
- **Neo4j:** (Optional) Model complex relationships as a graph.
- **Redis:** Caching, fast lookups, pub/sub notifications.
- **RabbitMQ:** Async processing (virus scan, OCR, AI enrichment).

## 2. API Layer

- **REST (AJAX/JSON):** Standard CRUD (upload, edit, list, delete evidence).
- **GraphQL:** Flexible queries (fetch all evidence for a user, with related cases/nodes).
- **WebSocket:** Real-time updates (evidence edited/added).

## 3. Editable Evidence & Node System

- **XState:** State machines for upload, edit, node interactions.
- **Drizzle ORM:** All DB operations (create, update, delete, link evidence).
- **AJAX/Fetch:** Client-server communication (REST/GraphQL).
- **Interactive Canvas:** Import evidence as nodes, drag/drop, connect, save relationships.

## 4. Example Flows

- **Upload Evidence:**
  - POST /api/users/:userId/evidence (multipart/form-data)
  - Save file, metadata, generate embedding (pgvector/Qdrant).
- **Edit Evidence:**
  - PATCH /api/users/:userId/evidence/:evidenceId
  - Update metadata, re-embed if content changes.
- **List/Search Evidence:**
  - GET /api/users/:userId/evidence
  - POST /api/users/:userId/evidence/search (semantic)
  - Fuzzy search in UI (Fuse.js).
- **Canvas Integration:**
  - Evidence/docs are nodes.
  - Import to canvas, connect nodes (evidence <-> case <-> report).
  - Save node positions/relationships (Drizzle/Neo4j).
- **XState Example:**
  - Use state machines for upload/edit flows.

## 5. Connections & Memory

- Use Neo4j or relational tables for relationships (evidence <-> case <-> user <-> report).
- Use Context7 MCP and enhanced index to remember/retrieve connections for AI/search.

## 6. File/Codebase Integration

- API endpoints: `src/routes/api/evidence/+server.ts` (REST) or `src/routes/api/graphql/+server.ts` (GraphQL).
- Svelte stores/XState for frontend state.
- Drizzle ORM for DB access.
- Qdrant/pgvector for semantic search.
- Fuse.js for UI search.
- Canvas for node editing/visualization.

## 7. Example: Evidence Node Save (AJAX)

- Use AJAX/GraphQL to save node edits/positions/relationships.

**Summary:**

- Use Drizzle/pgvector/Qdrant for storage/semantic search.
- XState for robust UI state.
- REST/GraphQL for API.
- Neo4j/relational for connections.
- Fuse.js for UI search.
- Canvas for node editing/visualization.
