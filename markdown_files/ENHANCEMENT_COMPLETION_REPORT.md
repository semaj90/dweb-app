## 🧪 PLAYWRIGHT E2E TESTING & TROUBLESHOOTING

### Playwright Setup for Local Development
- Playwright and @playwright/test are only installed in `web-app/sveltekit-frontend/package.json`.
- **Always run Playwright commands from the `web-app/sveltekit-frontend` directory.**
- If you see errors like:
  > Playwright Test did not expect test.describe() to be called here.
  > You have two different versions of @playwright/test.
  This means you have duplicate Playwright installs or are running from the wrong directory.

#### How to Fix Playwright Test Errors
1. **Clean up all node_modules and lock files:**
   ```powershell
   Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .\node_modules
   Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .\web-app\sveltekit-frontend\node_modules
   Remove-Item -Force .\package-lock.json
   Remove-Item -Force .\web-app\sveltekit-frontend\package-lock.json
   ```
2. **Reinstall dependencies in the correct place:**
   ```powershell
   cd .\web-app\sveltekit-frontend
   npm install
   ```
3. **Run Playwright tests:**
   ```powershell
   npx playwright test
   ```

#### Best Practices
- Never install Playwright in the monorepo root or other packages.
- If you add new tests, always add them to `web-app/sveltekit-frontend/tests/`.
- For local dev, ensure no other dev server is running before running Playwright tests.

#### Example Test Command
```powershell
cd web-app/sveltekit-frontend
npx playwright test
```
