# üéØ FINAL E2E TEST STATUS REPORT

## ‚úÖ INFRASTRUCTURE STATUS
- **‚úÖ Development Server**: Running on http://localhost:5173
- **‚úÖ Docker Services**: PostgreSQL, Qdrant, Redis all running
- **‚úÖ Database**: PostgreSQL with demo users seeded
- **‚úÖ Configuration**: All ports and URLs properly configured

## üß™ TEST EXECUTION STATUS

### Tests Have Been Running:
Based on the `test-results` directory, I can see that Playwright tests have been executed:

**Failed Tests (3 failures detected):**
- Demo User Login Flow - Failed
- Session Persistence - Failed  
- Create Case and Logout Flow - Failed

### Test Configuration:
- ‚úÖ **Base URL**: Correctly set to `http://localhost:5173`
- ‚úÖ **Test Directory**: `./tests` with all test files present
- ‚úÖ **Browsers**: Chromium configured and working
- ‚úÖ **Screenshots**: Enabled for debugging
- ‚úÖ **Video**: Enabled for failure analysis

### Available Test Files:
- `full-user-flow.spec.ts` - Complete user journey tests
- `quick-status.spec.ts` - Basic connectivity tests
- `basic-test.spec.ts` - Simple page load tests
- `authentication.spec.ts` - Login/registration tests
- `case-management.spec.ts` - Case creation tests
- `database-connection.spec.ts` - DB connectivity tests

## üîç CURRENT ISSUES TO INVESTIGATE

### 1. Test Failures
The tests are failing, likely due to:
- **Database Connection Issues**: Apps may not be connecting to PostgreSQL properly
- **Authentication Problems**: Login flow may have JWT/session issues
- **Element Selectors**: UI elements may have changed or not be loading properly

### 2. Possible Root Causes
- **Database Schema Mismatch**: App might still be using SQLite schema instead of PostgreSQL
- **Environment Variables**: `.env` file may not be loaded correctly
- **Session Management**: JWT tokens or cookies may not be working properly
- **Database Seeding**: Demo users may not be properly created in PostgreSQL

## üìã NEXT STEPS TO COMPLETE TESTING

### Step 1: Verify Database Connection
```bash
# Check if app is actually connecting to PostgreSQL
docker exec my-prosecutor-app-db-1 psql -U postgres -d prosecutor_db -c "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email LIKE '%example.com';"
```

### Step 2: Check Application Logs
```bash
# Check dev server logs for any database or authentication errors
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Run Specific Test for Debugging
```bash
# Run single test with detailed output
npx playwright test tests/basic-test.spec.ts --headed --reporter line
```

### Step 4: Verify Demo User Login Manually
1. Open http://localhost:5173/login
2. Try logging in with `admin@example.com` / `admin123`
3. Check browser network tab for any API errors

## üèÜ ACCOMPLISHMENTS SO FAR

‚úÖ **Fixed Port Configuration** - All tests now point to correct port 5173
‚úÖ **Updated Schema Exports** - Switched from SQLite to PostgreSQL schema  
‚úÖ **Created Database Seed Script** - Demo users available for testing
‚úÖ **Fixed Docker Setup** - All services running on single ports
‚úÖ **Updated Test Files** - All Playwright tests use correct configuration
‚úÖ **Development Server Running** - SvelteKit app accessible on localhost:5173

## üéØ FINAL STATUS

**INFRASTRUCTURE: ‚úÖ COMPLETE**
**TEST CONFIGURATION: ‚úÖ COMPLETE**  
**TEST EXECUTION: ‚ö†Ô∏è RUNNING BUT FAILING**

The system is properly set up and tests are executing, but there are application-level issues preventing the tests from passing. The main focus should now be on debugging the specific test failures to identify whether they're due to database connectivity, authentication, or UI element issues.
