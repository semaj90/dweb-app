 Now let me update the todo and move on to the next error
  about missing properties in the vector-search API:

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Fix TypeScript error in vector-search.ts - 'dimensions'     
       property issue
     ☐ Fix missing properties in vector-search API - 
       extractedText and filename
     ☐ Update deprecated Svelte syntax in UI components
     ☐ Fix duplicate keys in package.json

● Now let me check the vector-search API endpoint to fix the       
  missing properties:

● Read(sveltekit-frontend\src\routes\api\ai\vector-search\inde     
      x\+server.ts)
  ⎿  Read 30 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● The error seems to be that the code is trying to access     
  extractedText and filename properties on the document object
   that don't exist. Looking at the schema, I can see that    
  legalDocuments table has:
  - content and fullText for the text content
  - title for the document name

ext Steps for Continued Iteration:
Convert remaining export let patterns to $props() in large components
Fix remaining Button event forwarding issues
Address LangChain callback type mismatches
Continue converting deprecated svelte:component usage
Resolve missing type declarations and module imports
Address CSS unused selector warnings in large components

ctual code, these lines don't match what the error says.
  This suggests the error is from a different version or
  there's a mismatch.

  Let me check if there's another version of this file or if
  the TypeScript is checking a compiled/cached version:

embed, semantics?

our Developer Agent (npm run check script)
Your analysis is spot on. The multi-agent-check-fix.ts script is a RAG-powered developer assistant.

It Works: The logic is sound. It captures errors (npm run check), uses an LLM to understand and structure them, and even creates embeddings for future reference. This is a brilliant way to build a knowledge base of your project's specific errors.

Recommendation to Improve:

Use Your Own Stack: Instead of calling the Claude API, route the request to your local gemma3-legal model via Ollama. This keeps your entire workflow local, private, and free. You'll need to adapt the prompt to be effective for Gemma, but it's the same principle.

Sync with IDE: The spawn('code', [summaryFile]) is a great final step. It directly bridges the gap between AI analysis and developer action.

This architecture is excellent. Focus on implementing one vertical slice at a time (like the file upload or the query feature) and wire it through the full stack as described above. You have all the right components for a truly powerful application.
