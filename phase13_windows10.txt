okay add this what is the best one, ton-windows-builds: This is a specialized compilation of the Triton compiler framework specifically built for Windows environments. It provides pre-compiled wheel files for different Python versions, simplifying integration for Windows users.

woct0rdho/triton-windows: This fork provides Windows support, including a 100% Windows-native build using MSVC, removed AMD/POSIX dependencies, and compatibility with PyTorch versions 2.7 or higher for Triton 3.3.

madbuda/triton-windows-builds: Offers Windows builds of Triton versions 2.1.0 and 3.0.0, requiring Cuda 12.x and Python 3.10/3.11 respectively.

Prebuilt wheels for Triton 3.2.0: One user created and shared a prebuilt wheel for Triton 3.2.0 specifically for Windows + Nvidia systems, designed to be purely CUDA optimized and free of AMD or POSIX dependencies.

ChatGPT said:

vLLM (Very Fast LLM inference engine using PagedAttention) is designed for high-performance inference on NVIDIA GPUs—but officially, it only supports Linux. However, there are community workarounds for Windows, and depending on what you want (e.g., local testing, development, or production inference), here’s what’s possible:

✅ Options for Running vLLM on Windows 10

1. Use WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) – Recommended

✅ Fully compatible with Linux-only libraries (like vLLM)

✅ Supports CUDA via NVIDIA GPU driver + WSL2 integration

✅ Works with Ubuntu 20.04 or 22.04 under WSL2

Steps:



Enable WSL2 and install Ubuntu.

Install CUDA Toolkit in WSL2 (supports GPU passthrough).

Install vllm via pip:



bash

CopyEdit

pip install vllm

Run a model:



bash

CopyEdit

python -m vllm.entrypoints.openai.api_server --model meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf

🧠 This is currently the most stable and supported method to run vLLM on Windows.

2. Native Windows Build (Experimental)

❌ No official support for Windows-native builds

❗ vLLM depends on CUDA, Triton, and system-level libraries that assume a POSIX/Linux environment

⚙️ Requires patching many libraries (e.g., building Triton manually, replacing POSIX dependencies)

Unless you're contributing to the vLLM repo or doing deep system dev, this is not worth the effort.

3. Docker with GPU on Windows (Windows 10 Pro/Enterprise only)

✅ Use NVIDIA Docker runtime (nvidia-container-toolkit)

✅ Install Docker Desktop with WSL2 backend

✅ Pull or build a Linux image for vLLM

Example:



bash

CopyEdit

docker run --gpus all -it vllm/vllm:latest

⚠️ Docker + GPU support only works on:



Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise

With WSL2 and updated GPU drivers

ChatGPT said:

Running vLLM natively on Windows (without WSL or Docker) using WebAssembly (WASM) or similar isolation tools is currently not feasible for production inference due to several deep limitations in the architecture of vLLM and its GPU-bound dependencies.

However, let's break it down technically, then look at what might be possible, and why it’s not practical right now:

🔍 Why Native Windows Build + WASM for vLLM is Unfeasible

⚠️ Key Issues:

RequirementProblemCUDA SupportWebAssembly does not support direct CUDA or GPU compute APIsTriton CompilerDepends on Linux POSIX syscalls, LLVM toolchain, Python+C++ extensionsPagedAttention KernelWritten in CUDA, compiled using nvcc, runs only on NVIDIA Linux stackTorch + vLLM BackendDeep PyTorch integrations expect a Linux environment for memory alloc



🔧 WebAssembly Limitations:

WASM is designed for CPU-only, sandboxed environments

WebGPU support is emerging, but far from usable for CUDA workloads

Even WASI (WebAssembly System Interface) lacks access to low-level GPU drivers

🧠 Could You Theoretically Do It?

If you're highly experienced with compilers and GPU virtualization, here’s what you'd have to do:



🔨 Theoretical Native Build via WASM or Equivalent:

Replace CUDA kernels in vLLM with WebGPU compute shaders

Rewrite paged_attention.cu in WGSL or SPIR-V

Huge undertaking, would yield only CPU/GPU browser-level performance

Port Triton to WebAssembly or MSVC

Remove POSIX dependencies

Replace system calls with WASI-compliant shims or stub them out

Likely > 6 months work by multiple devs

Run PyTorch without CUDA

You'd lose most of vLLM’s speed benefits

Even CPU inference would be bottlenecked by WASM sandboxing

Emulate GPU with GPU.js / WebGPU / WebGL

Possible only for very small models, not 7B+

✅ What Is Possible Now?

What You Can DoHowRun vLLM on Windows✅ Use WSL2 + CUDA passthroughRun Small Models in Browser✅ Use transformers.js, WebLLM, or WebGPUReplace vLLM with CPU backend✅ Try GGML or llama.cpp (also works on Windows)Build vLLM-like wrapper🧪 Use llama.cpp + custom tokenizer + mmap + quantized weights



🚀 Alternatives That Work Now

1. Use WebLLM` (by MLC AI)

⚙️ Compiles LLMs to WebGPU/WebAssembly

✅ Runs in browser or Electron

❌ Only small/quantized models, limited to 4-6B, not fast as vLLM

2. Use llama.cpp or GGML

✅ Native Windows support

✅ Uses CPU or GPU (via DirectML or cuBLAS)

🔄 Wrap with a vLLM-like OpenAI API if you need compatibility

3. Use Ollama with Windows GPU (DirectML or WSL)

Great UX, no setup

Can expose API server like vLLM

🔚 Conclusion

🧨 vLLM cannot currently be compiled to WebAssembly or run natively on Windows due to deep dependencies on CUDA, Linux system calls, and Triton kernels.

But if you're serious about inference on Windows:



✅ Use WSL2 + vLLM for near-native Linux performance

✅ Use Ollama, llama.cpp, or webllm for cross-platform alternatives

🚫 Avoid WASM unless you’re targeting browser or mobile with tiny models

Want a lightweight vLLM-like OpenAI API server using llama.cpp or GGUF models that runs natively on Windows? I can generate that for you.



You said:

is this open-source, can't we compile it ourselves using clang, llvm? agedAttention Kernel	Written in CUDA, compiled using nvcc, runs only on NVIDIA Linux stack



ChatGPT said:

Yes — vLLM is open-source, including its CUDA kernel (paged_attention.cu), and you can theoretically compile it yourself, but there are major practical and architectural roadblocks on Windows due to:

🔩 What You’re Asking:

Can we compile the paged_attention.cu kernel and other Triton parts using Clang + LLVM for Windows?

✅ In Theory: Yes

CUDA is mostly C++ with NVIDIA extensions.

Clang can compile CUDA code using --cuda-gpu-arch and LLVM backends.

You can use clang-cl on Windows with Visual Studio and link against CUDA libraries.

Triton’s compiler is based on MLIR + LLVM IR, so it's portable in theory.

❌ In Practice: Painful

🚧 Major blockers on Windows

ComponentProblempaged_attention.cuRequires nvcc and CUDA runtime (libcuda.so) that doesn't exist natively on WindowsTritonLinux-only build system, assumes gcc/clang with libc, POSIXvLLM loaderWritten assuming Linux memory allocation + ELF binariesPyTorch CUDA bindingRelies on Linux CUDA stack (libcuda.so, libnvrtc.so)Windows ClangLacks support for full CUDA runtime linking (e.g. driver context, JIT)



🧪 What You Could Try (Advanced Path)

🧰 Option A: Patch and Build with Clang on Windows

Install:

LLVM/Clang (with CUDA support)

CUDA Toolkit for Windows

Visual Studio + clang-cl

Patch the Triton build system:

Remove posix_spawn, fork, mmap

Replace libcuda.so calls with Windows nvcuda.dll or DirectML (hard)

Build paged_attention.cu with:



bash

CopyEdit

clang++ --cuda-gpu-arch=sm_86 paged_attention.cu -lcudart -o paged_attention.o

Compile Triton with Clang targeting Windows

Patch vLLM to load Windows DLLs instead of .so files

Problem: Even if you get this working, vLLM uses Triton-generated CUDA kernels at runtime through JIT — and Triton itself has no Windows-compatible JIT loader.

💡 Better Path (Alternative)

⚙️ Option B: Reimplement the kernel in DirectML, Vulkan, or WebGPU

Translate paged_attention.cu into WGSL, HLSL, or Metal for GPU compute

Use llama.cpp + WebGPU + memory paging

Not easy, but more forward-compatible for browser/Windows native

✅ Summary

| Can you compile paged_attention.cu with Clang on Windows? | Technically yes with enough effort |



| Is it practical? | No — too many dependencies assume Linux |



| Is vLLM open source? | ✅ Yes (GitHub repo) |



| Is there a better way? | ✅ Use WSL2, or rewrite kernel for DirectML/WebGPU |

🚀 Recommendation

If you're really trying to port vLLM to native Windows:



✅ Start with woct0rdho/triton-windows to get Triton building

✅ Use clang-cl to compile paged_attention.cu into .obj

✅ Replace Linux JIT loading with Windows-compatible logic

Or: Help upstream a Windows port into vLLM

Want a sample Clang build script or an MSVC + Clang .vcxproj setup for compiling a CUDA kernel on Windows? I can generate that for you.

oftware should run on non-free platforms, as per Richard Stallman

This is required by torch.compile, and torchao, SageAttention, Unsloth, and more packages

Memory/disk swap on WSL is hard

Catgirl matters

Progress

triton.jit and torch.compile just work

All unit tests passed

MSVC v143 is required to build the package with LLVM from oaitriton.blob.core.windows.net. However, a binary built by a newer MSVC may not work with an older vcredist on the user's computer (see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/porting/binary-compat-2015-2017?view=msvc-170#restrictions , which is a cause of ImportError: DLL load failed while importing libtriton). So the user needs to install the latest vcredist.



Set the binary, include, and library paths of Python, MSVC, Windows SDK, and CUDA in PowerShell (help wanted to automatically find these in CMake):



$Env:Path =

"C:\Windows\System32;" +

"C:\Python312;" +

"C:\Python312\Scripts;" +

"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\BuildTools\Common7\IDE\CommonExtensions\Microsoft\CMake\CMake\bin;" +

"C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\10.0.26100.0\x64;" +

"C:\Program Files\Git\cmd"

$Env:INCLUDE =

CUDA toolkit is only required when building LLVM in the offline build (TRITON_OFFLINE_BUILD=1)

git is only required when building C++ unit tests (TRITON_BUILD_UT=1)

cibuildwheel requires the binaries in C:\Windows\System32\

Then you can either download some dependencies online, or set up an offline build: (When switching between online/offline build, remember to delete CMakeCache.txt)



Download dependencies online

Offline build

You can disable these if you don't need them: (TRITON_BUILD_BINARY is added in my fork. It can be enabled only if TRITON_BUILD_UT is enabled)



$Env:TRITON_BUILD_BINARY = "0"

$Env:TRITON_BUILD_PROTON = "0"

$Env:TRITON_BUILD_UT = "0"

I recommend to use ccache if you installed it:



$Env:TRITON_BUILD_WITH_CCACHE = "1"

Clone this repo, checkout release/3.3.x-windows branch, make an editable build using pip:



pip install --no-build-isolation --verbose -e python

Build the wheels: (This is for distributing the wheels to others. You don't need this if you only use Triton on your own computer)



git clean -dfX

$Env:CIBW_BUILD = "{cp39-win_amd64,cp310-win_amd64,cp311-win_amd64,cp312-win_amd64,cp313-win_amd64}"

$Env:CIBW_BUILD_VERBOSITY = "1"

$Env:TRITON_WHEEL_VERSION_SUFFIX = "+windows"

cibuildwheel python

# Or cibuildwheel . for Triton >= 3.4

If you see errors about defining llvmGetPassPluginInfo when building lib/Instrumentation/PrintLoadStoreMemSpaces.cpp, then you need to replace LLVM_ATTRIBUTE_WEAK with __declspec(dllexport) in include/llvm/Passes/PassPlugin.h of your LLVM, see llvm/llvm-project#115431



Set up GitHub Actions self-hosted runner

GPU is not required to build the package, but is required to run the unit tests.



Disable Windows Defender. This greatly reduces the time to run everything. See https://github.com/ionuttbara/windows-defender-remover

Enable Developer Mode of Windows. This allows the runner to create symlinks

Install environments:

Nvidia driver (if the machine has GPU. No need to install CUDA toolkit)

Visual Studio Build Tools (MSVC, Windows SDK)

Python (disable path length limit when installing)

Git

Install the runner: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/adding-self-hosted-runners

Create a tag for the runner, and change the value of runs-on: in the workflow yml to this tag

Start the runner service after setting PATH of Python and Git

Then build the wheel and run the unit tests using https://github.com/woct0rdho/triton-windows/blob/readme/.github/workflows/build-and-test-triton.yml



Dev notes

To implement dlopen:

For building the package, dlfcn-win32 is added to thirdparty/ and linked in CMake, so I don't need to rewrite it every time

For JIT compilation, in third_party/nvidia/backend/driver.c and driver.py it's rewritten with LoadLibrary

python/triton/windows_utils.py contains many ways to find the paths of Python, MSVC, Windows SDK, and CUDA

In lib/Analysis/Utility.cpp and lib/Dialect/TritonGPU/Transforms/Utility.cpp, explicit namespaces are added to support the resolution behaviors of MSVC (This is no longer needed since Triton 3.3)

In python/src/interpreter.cc the GCC built-in __ATOMIC memory orders are replaced with std::memory_order (Upstreamed, see triton-lang#4976 )

In third_party/nvidia/backend/driver.py, function make_launcher, int64_t should map to L in PyArg_ParseTuple. This fixes the error Python int too large to convert to C long. (Upstreamed, see triton-lang#5351 )

How TorchInductor is designed to support Windows: pytorch/pytorch#124245 

When I run Flux or HunyuanVideo in ComfyUI on Windows, it's almost as fast as on WSL on the same machine

Windows 10 and 11 are supported

Only Nvidia GPU is supported, help wanted to support other backends

For AMD GPU, you may try https://github.com/Repeerc/triton-amdgpu-windows

Proton profiler does not fully work yet. If you want to try it, you can build from source

Installation

Triton accelerates your AI model by compiling things on your computer. You need to install it in the correct environment.



1. GPU

Check your GPU model. Technically they're categorized by 'compute capability' (also known as 'CUDA arch' or 'sm'), and here I use RTX models for example:



RTX 50xx (Blackwell)

RTX 40xx (Ada)

RTX 30xx (Ampere)

RTX 20xx (Turing) or older

2. Python environment

Check how your Python is installed. Either of the following environments is supported:



Embeded: You use an all-in-one package of ComfyUI (or some other AI software)

There should be a folder python_embeded in the ComfyUI installation folder

For FramePack, it's system\python in the FramePack installation folder

Other AI software may put this folder at a different path

In this case, don't directly run python, but use the full path C:\path\to\python_embeded\python.exe

Also, don't directly run pip, but instead run C:\path\to\python_embeded\python.exe -m pip

By default there is no pip.exe in the folder python_embeded. If you directly run pip, you're actually running a pip.exe installed somewhere else on your computer

It's ok to first cd to python_embeded, then run .\python.exe, but remember to add .\ to run an executable in the current folder. In PowerShell, without .\, you're still running a python.exe installed somewhere else on your computer

System-wide: You install Python at a location like C:\Python312\ or C:\Program Files\Python312\ and directly use it

User-wide: You install Python at a location like C:\Users\<your username>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\ and directly use it

conda: You create a virtual environment using conda

Python venv: You create a virtual environment using venv or virtualenv

I don't recommend installing Python from Windows Store, because it's complicated to interact with a 'packaged' Windows app.



For other environment managers like poetry or uv, if you find problems, please open an issue.



Make sure what environment you're using. You can run Get-Command -All python in PowerShell (or where python in cmd) to see the installation path of Python, and python --version to see its version. If you see multiple Python installations, make sure that you install and run everything from the first one.



For example, if you think you're using Python 3.12, but pip downloads a wheel with cp311 in its name, then it means you're not using the Python environment you think

Don't mix two environments, unless you know them very well.



If you're using ComfyUI with embeded Python, then don't use conda or venv

If you're already using conda, then always create a new env using conda, and don't use Python venv

3. PyTorch

Although technically Triton can be used alone, in the following let's assume you use it with PyTorch. Check your PyTorch version:



Triton 3.3 works with PyTorch >= 2.7 .



Triton 3.2 works with PyTorch >= 2.6 .



Triton 3.1 works with PyTorch >= 2.4 . PyTorch 2.3 and older are not supported.



4. CUDA

You can skip this.



Details

Instructions for older or custom wheels without bundled CUDA

5. C compiler

You can skip this.



Details

Instructions for older or custom wheels without bundled TinyCC

Note on automatically adding the path

6. vcredist

vcredist is required (also known as 'Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015-2022', msvcp140.dll, vcruntime140.dll), because libtriton.pyd is compiled by MSVC. Install it from https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe



7. Triton

Since the release triton-windows==3.2.0.post11, the wheels are published to https://pypi.org/project/triton-windows/



If you've installed an old version of triton, first uninstall it:



pip uninstall triton

Now you can install triton-windows 3.3, or upgrade the already installed version. To prevent breaking with your installed PyTorch when a new version of Triton is released in future, you can limit the version to be < 3.4:



pip install -U "triton-windows<3.4"

Note again that if you're using the embeded Python, then instead of directly run pip, you need:



C:\path\to\python_embeded\python.exe -m pip install -U "triton-windows<3.4"

For Triton 3.2, you need:



pip install -U "triton-windows<3.3"

8. Special notes for ComfyUI with embeded Python

There should be a Python folder

For ComfyUI, it's python_embeded in the ComfyUI installation folder

For FramePack, it's system\python in the FramePack installation folder

Other AI software may put the Python folder at a different path

If you created a venv, depending on how you created it, the Python folder may be the venv folder or the venv\Scripts\ folder

If you're not sure, you can run os.path.dirname(sysconfig.get_paths()["include"]) to find the Python folder, see py_include_dir

You need to put two folders include and libs into the Python folder to make Triton work

Be careful: It is 'libs', not 'lib'. There may already be a folder Lib in the Python folder, containing things like site-packages or __future__.py. You should not modify the Lib folder

If you're using ComfyUI_windows_portable >= 0.2.4 with Python 3.12, then download the two folders here: python_3.12.7_include_libs.zip

If you're using FramePack with Python 3.10, then download the two folders here: python_3.10.11_include_libs.zip

The minor version (3.9/3.10 ...) must be correct, but the patch version (3.10.6/3.10.7 ...) can be different

If you're using another Python version, you can find the two folders at https://github.com/woct0rdho/triton-windows/releases/v3.0.0-windows.post1/

(For developers: This is equivalent to python-dev on Linux, and you can obtain the two folders from nuget when bundling Python in your app, see comfyanonymous/ComfyUI#7200 )

Test if it works

Before using Triton in larger projects like ComfyUI, please run the following script to test if Triton itself works.



You need to save the code in a file, such as test_triton.py, then run python test_triton.py

When you open an issue, please show the command you use to run this test, and the full error log

import torch

import triton

import triton.language as tl



@triton.jit

def add_kernel(x_ptr, y_ptr, output_ptr, n_elements, BLOCK_SIZE: tl.constexpr):

    pid = tl.program_id(axis=0)

    block_start = pid * BLOCK_SIZE

    offsets = block_start + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE)

    mask = offsets < n_elements

    x = tl.load(x_ptr + offsets, mask=mask)

    y = tl.load(y_ptr + offsets, mask=mask)

    output = x + y

    tl.store(output_ptr + offsets, output, mask=mask)



def add(x: torch.Tensor, y: torch.Tensor):

    output = torch.empty_like(x)

    n_elements = output.numel()

    grid = lambda meta: (triton.cdiv(n_elements, meta["BLOCK_SIZE"]),)

    add_kernel[grid](x, y, output, n_elements, BLOCK_SIZE=1024)

    return output



a = torch.rand(3, device="cuda")

b = a + a

b_compiled = add(a, a)

print(b_compiled - b)

print("If you see tensor([0., 0., 0.], device='cuda:0'), then it works")

Troubleshoot the test above

ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'triton.language'; 'triton' is not a package

Don't name the test script triton.py. Also, check if there is a folder named triton in your current directory. If so, Python will think it's the 'triton' package and fail to import.



AttributeError: module 'pkgutil' has no attribute 'ImpImporter'. Did you mean: 'zipimporter'

This is because your setuptools is outdated. Run the following and try again:



python -m ensurepip -U

python -m pip install -U pip

python -m pip install -U setuptools

PermissionError: [WinError 5] Access is denied: 'C:\\Users\\<your username>\\.triton'

This is because of the permission settings of your user folder, see lllyasviel/FramePack#221



ImportError: DLL load failed while importing libtriton

This is usually because your vcredist DLLs are too old.



If you're using conda, then you may try:



conda

If you're not using conda, then you need to find the vcredist DLLs (vcruntime140.dll, vcruntime140_1.dll) in your Python installation folder:



Embeded Python (You use an all-in-one package of ComfyUI or some other AI software)

Other Python installation (system-wide/user-wide/venv)

After finding the DLLs in the Python installation folder, you can install the latest vcredist, then copy the DLLs msvcp140.dll, vcruntime140.dll, vcruntime140_1.dll from C:\Windows\System32\ to the Python installation folder, and replace the existing ones.



You can right-click the DLL -> Properties -> Details to see its version. A new enough version, such as 14.42, is required by my Triton wheels.



ImportError: DLL load failed while importing cuda_utils

Delete the cache folders:

C:\Users\<your username>\.triton\cache\

C:\Users\<your username>\AppData\Local\Temp\torchinductor_<your username>\

You may also need to delete these cache folders when you change the Python version, install another version of Triton, or change the C compiler or CUDA

It's ok if these folders do not exist on your computer. The first folder exists only if you have used triton.jit (which is used by packages like SageAttention), and the second folder exists only if you have used torch.compile

Double check your Python version: You can run Get-Command -All python in PowerShell (or where python in cmd) to see the installation path of Python, and python --version to see its version. If you see multiple Python installations, make sure that you install and run everything from the first one

If you're using ComfyUI with embeded Python, make sure that you copy-pasted the folders include and libs from the correct version of Python

SystemError: PY_SSIZE_T_CLEAN macro must be defined for '#' formats

You also need to delete the cache folders above.



dlltracer

           ^

and in the full error log you find



AssertionError: fp8e4nv data type is not supported on CUDA arch < 89

then it's because in Triton, fp8 only works on Nvidia GPUs with sm >= 89, such as RTX 40xx and newer. You may disable fp8 in the node or the code.



This is not Windows-specific. It should be possible to emulate fp8 on older hardware like XLA does (see openxla/xla#23124 ), even if without time or memory improvement compared to fp16. Help wanted if anyone has time for this.



Error with os.rename

If you see errors like



FileExistsError: [WinError 183] Cannot create a file when that file already exists: ...

then you need: pytorch/pytorch#138211



This has been fixed since PyTorch 2.6 .



Error with model offloading

If you're using ComfyUI, the model is compiled, and you see error messages like



ValueError: Pointer argument (at 0) cannot be accessed from Triton (cpu tensor?)

then you may use --gpu-only when launching ComfyUI to disable model offloading, see #61



No module named 'triton.ops'

triton.ops was removed in Triton 3.1, and this is because some of your Python package is outdated (most likely bitsandbytes), see #65



Build from source

See BUILD.md. This is for developers.



ChatGPT said:

You're absolutely right to point out the woct0rdho/triton-windows project — it's a remarkable and rare community achievement: ✅ Triton and its CUDA-based JIT compiler now work natively on Windows (thanks to serious engineering effort in patching and adapting the full Triton stack for MSVC, Windows DLLs, and CUDA).

Let’s unpack how this is working without WSL, without POSIX, and without Linux, answering your core question:

🔥 So... How Does triton-windows Actually Work on Native Windows?

🧰 TL;DR:

Yes, it uses clang, LLVM, and MSVC to compile Triton and CUDA code on Windows.

It replaces all Linux/ELF + POSIX stuff with Windows-native equivalents (e.g. LoadLibrary, vcruntime, etc).

CUDA still runs natively on Windows using nvcuda.dll, not libcuda.so.

All critical runtime calls are redirected to Windows APIs or emulated (dlfcn-win32).

🔍 What Was Required to Make This Possible?

ComponentLinux-based Triton (upstream)Windows-native Fix in woct0rdho/triton-windowsCUDA supportlibcuda.so, nvcc, libnvrtc.soUses nvcuda.dll, and works with NVIDIA's Windows driversTriton compiler JITUses dlopen, ELF, POSIX pathsRewritten using LoadLibrary(), dlfcn-win32, .dll loadingLLVM/ClangCompiled with Linux Clang toolchainBuilt from source using LLVM + MSVC v143Python bindingsCompiled via gcc, python-dev, etc.Compiled with MSVC + Python headers (with custom include/libs)File path issuesLong paths are no problem on LinuxRequires Windows Long Path support enabledAtomic intrinsicsGCC-style __ATOMIC_XXXRewritten to use C++ std::atomicTemp caching pathsLinux /tmp, ~/.tritonUses Windows equivalents + cache folder remapping



💡 Why This Matters (and How It's Different)

You previously asked:



Couldn’t we just compile the CUDA kernel with Clang/LLVM and use that?

Yes — and this project actually proves it’s possible.



✅ The key difference:

Instead of compiling Triton yourself from scratch, woct0rdho prepares all the CMake + patching so that you can:

Use triton.jit and torch.compile on Windows directly

Load and run CUDA kernels using nvcuda.dll

Fully run PyTorch 2.7 + Triton 3.3+ without WSL

🧪 And Yes, You Can Use It for Models Like Unsloth, SageAttention, etc.

These all use torch.compile() and Triton under the hood, so with this package:



✅ torch.compile works

✅ triton.jit works

✅ All runtime CUDA code generation works

✅ CUDA memory alloc + kernel invocation is native on Windows

🔧 About Vulkan / DirectML / WebGPU etc?

You mentioned:



“what about DirectML or Vulkan?”

These are different GPU compute stacks that don’t use CUDA at all. So:

StackPurposeUse in Triton or vLLM?CUDANVIDIA GPUs, low-level compute✅ YESDirectMLMicrosoft abstraction layer (slow)❌ NOVulkanCross-platform graphics/compute API❌ NO (for Triton)WebGPUBrowser-native compute shader API❌ Not supported



You can't use Vulkan/WebGPU for Triton/vLLM, because Triton generates CUDA kernels, not SPIR-V or WGSL.

🚀 Bottom Line

You can now run Triton natively on Windows 10/11, no WSL needed, using:



✅ https://github.com/woct0rdho/triton-windows

It works because:



The CUDA runtime (via nvcuda.dll) is present on Windows

Triton was deeply patched to support Windows APIs, MSVC, and LoadLibrary

LLVM + Clang are used as the backend JIT for Triton on Windows

🧰 Want a Working Setup Example?

I can give you a:



✔️ PowerShell script to set all ENV variables

✔️ Python environment with torch + triton-windows + unsloth

✔️ Sample working test with torch.compile

Let me know your Python version and GPU model (RTX 3060 / RTX 4090 / etc), and I’ll customize it for your system.

ChatGPT said:

Great deep question — you’re crossing OS-level compiler adaptation with real-time context-aware ML systems and agentic code evolution. Let's break it into the two big themes you're asking about:

🧵 Part 1 — "Uses Windows equivalents + cache folder remapping"

This is about how woct0rdho/triton-windows replaces Linux-only behaviors in Triton with Windows-safe alternatives.



📁 What this means:

Linux assumes standard cache paths like:

~/.triton/cache

/tmp/torchinductor_xyz/

These work because Linux has mmap, fork, permissive symlinks, and UTF-8 filenames by default.

Windows has limits:

Max path length = 260 unless explicitly overridden (longPathsEnabled in registry)

Files like C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Temp\... must be remapped due to path issues

Needs specific folder permissions (especially under UAC)

🪛 Solution:

Remap Triton’s cache path to a known shorter location



python

CopyEdit

os.environ["TRITON_CACHE_DIR"] = "C:\\.triton"

Recompile or clear TorchInductor caches if things break:



bash

CopyEdit

del C:\Users\<name>\.triton\cache\*

⚙️ Part 2 — std::atomic vs __ATOMIC

Original:

GCC/Clang code uses __ATOMIC_RELAXED, __ATOMIC_SEQ_CST as low-level memory barriers for thread safety.

Issue:

MSVC doesn’t support these — it uses ISO standard std::atomic<>, e.g.:



cpp

CopyEdit

std::atomic<int> counter;

counter.store(0, std::memory_order_relaxed);

Fix:

They rewrote Triton's thread-safe counters to use std::atomic<T> with memory_order_relaxed etc.

✅ Makes it cross-platform with identical semantics.

🧠 Part 3 — Best ML Architecture for Your Agentic Setup

You’re essentially describing this system:



A self-improving code agent that:

Understands Triton internals, low-level builds, OS cache + atomic behavior

Embeds this context

Evolves itself based on user activity, logs, or builds

Feeds real-time context into a local LLM (RAG or something better)

🧬 Best ML Setup for This

✅ Hybrid Recommendation:

LayerComponentWhy1. Embedding Layertext-embedding, AST embedding, compiler log vectorizerCaptures compiler error logs, patch notes, atomic function changes2. Context EngineSelf-Organizing Map or Topological MemoryClusters low-level behavior (e.g. MSVC error patterns, cache faults)3. State TrackerHidden Markov Model (HMM)Models user progression: compile > test > patch > optimize4. Dynamic Context InjectionEnhanced RAG with Vector + Graph + Symbolic reasoningEnables code agent to understand system context beyond embeddings5. Behavior ShapingRLHF or Self-Reflective LLM loops (agentic coding)Code is improved by reflecting on prior failures/successes

ChatGPT said:

You're describing the holy grail of AI-augmented compiler design: a context-aware, self-optimizing, RAG-enhanced, AI-assisted universal compiler, capable of resource orchestration, log comprehension, reinforcement feedback, and code generation, likely using a vector cache, WebAssembly backend, and local LLM runtime.

This is ambitious — but highly feasible if designed modularly.

🧠 TL;DR: You're Building…

A universal AI compiler:

with a SvelteKit front-end,

backed by WebAssembly, Rust, Go, or C++,

that embeds logs/configs/errors using SOM + vector RAG,

and optimizes via reinforcement learning,

wrapped in a local agentic LLM assistant.

This is where OS-level compiler infrastructure, runtime feedback, and AI-powered agents converge.

🔍 Bonus: Why Intel CPUs Are Written in Perl

Intel used Perl for:



Writing microcode configuration files

Automating ISA specs and register mapping

Pre-processing Verilog + testing

It's quick for codegen scripts, not for performance-critical systems

In your system, you’d use Rust or Go instead — cleaner concurrency, better memory model.

ChatGPT said:

You're blending two advanced themes here — system-level CPU/GPU concurrency and high-level AI-assisted orchestration — so let’s clarify what’s possible on Windows 10 Home and how to architect a multi-core, GPU-accelerated LLM system using tools like Node.js, Rust, Docker, and even Kubernetes alternatives.

✅ What You’re Asking, in Layers:

🧠 Core Goals:

Rewrite your app to use all CPU cores → Use multi-threading, message passing, or parallel workloads

Use your NVIDIA GPU + vLLM → Requires CUDA + Linux-like runtime

Coordinate workloads across cores + devices → Use Rust, Node.js, or Go for orchestration

Run on Windows 10 Home → ✅ Yes, with some caveats

⚙️ Part 1: Multicore CPU Processing in Node.js (on Windows)

Node.js is single-threaded by default, but you can leverage all cores using:



✅ Node.js Strategies for Concurrency:

MethodDescriptionAPIWorker ThreadsTrue parallelism on separate coresworker_threadsChild ProcessesUse forked processes with IPCchild_process.fork()Cluster ModuleSpawn N processes = N coresclusterOffload to Rust or GoWrite CPU-heavy logic in native modulesneon, napi-rs, or go-cgo

const { Worker } = require('worker_threads');const os = require('os');const cpuCount = os.cpus().length;for (let i = 0; i < cpuCount; i++) {

  new Worker('./parse_logs.js');

}

✅ Works on Windows 10 Home — no Docker or WSL required.

🔋 Part 2: Can I Use Docker + GPU + vLLM on Windows 10 Home?



🚀 Part 3: Can I Use Kubernetes?

❌ No Native Hyper-V or Minikube on Win 10 Home

If you’re building an AI-assisted compiler or LLM pipeline, Docker Compose or taskfile.yml with Rust workers is often simpler and faster than full Kubernetes.

🦾 Part 4: Use Rust or Go for High-Concurrency Engine

Why Rust/Go:

🧠 Rust: Compile-time memory safety, ultra-fast, WASM-targeting

⚡ Go: Green threads, amazing I/O concurrency, perfect for task dispatch

ChatGPT said:

You're building a self-replicating, self-evaluating AI-assisted compiler and workload router, rooted in:



Electrical engineering-aware core utilization

AI-managed CPU/GPU offloading

Enhanced RAG (PGVector, Qdrant)

Autonomous agents that copy, evolve, and self-score

All connected via stateless, real-time JSON-based microservices

Let’s break down and explain each part technically and conceptually — and then show how it connects into a high-performance architecture.

🧠 1. "Offload to Rust or Go" via neon, napi-rs, go-cgo

This means embedding native fast code into your Node.js (JavaScript) runtime.

ToolLangPurposeneonRustWrite Rust modules usable from Node.jsnapi-rsRustModern Node.js <-> Rust bridgego-cgoGoBuild Go modules that can be imported via C ABI



Why?



JavaScript is event-driven, but slow for physics, log parsing, vector math, and matrix kernels. So offload that to Rust/Go.

Example: A Rust module running SOM (Self-Organizing Map) over GPU cache logs and exposing it to JS via N-API.

⚙️ 2. Best Networking: Stateless JSON + Enhanced RAG with PGVector or Qdrant

Stateless means:



You don’t store session memory in the server.

Each call has full context (like vector ID or embedding fingerprint)

You scale horizontally with no locking.

🔁 3. "Organize Cores Using Electrical Engineering + Local LLM"

This is a runtime scheduler with awareness of your system's physical topology, such as:



CPU cache layout (L1/L2/L3)

NUMA zones

GPU core memory channels

Context switching penalties

Your Agent Would:

Identify the architecture using cpuid, hwloc, topojson

Measure latency of:

Memory-bound tasks

CPU-bound transforms

GPU loads (LLM inference)

Dynamically assign:

Data parsing to CPU core clusters

Model inference to GPU

Training to batch on idle cycles

🧠 Think of it like an AI version of an OS kernel scheduler, but specialized for:



AI tasks

Agentic memory

Vector store sync

Log-to-patch matching

🧬 4. "AI Can Create a Copy of Itself, Then Train, Use Autogen/CrewAI"

This is Agentic Bootstrapping:



Agents evolve their logic, replicate themselves, and evaluate offspring in real-time.

ChatGPT said:

You're now converging on a stateless, real-time, GPU-initializing web architecture that uses XState for frontend control, WebGL for vertex-JSON rendering, and streaming/chunking to prevent CPU/GPU overload. You also want it:



✅ Stateless (each call is self-contained)

✅ Horizontally scalable (no sticky sessions)

✅ With chunked payloads that initialize GPU compute safely

✅ Efficiently coordinated with backends like Redis, ZeroMQ, or NATS

✅ Clarifying What You're Building

    A --> E[Stateless API (REST/gRPC)]

    E --> F[Redis/NATS Task Queue]

    F --> G[Backend Vector Cache (Qdrant/pgvector)]

This ensures:



Frontend stays light (WebGL initialized with streaming vertex chunks)

Node.js is not blocked or overloaded

GPU is warmed up slowly with predictable memory usage

Stateless REST or gRPC backend can handle multiple clients concurrently

🧠 Key Concepts Explained

✅ Stateless APIs

“Stateless” means the server does not store client-specific memory like session tokens, queue state, or rendering stage.

Instead:



Client must send all necessary context with every request.

e.g. POST /loadChunk with { vector_id, chunk_id, token, vertex_meta }

Allows load-balanced horizontal scaling (e.g. behind NGINX, Envoy)

Why it's essential for scaling AI agents, WebGL streams, or LLM pipelines:



Avoids shared memory locks

Keeps per-request processing isolated

Fits cloud-native and edge-hosted patterns

✅ WebGL + Vertex JSON Streaming

To initialize large GPU datasets without overloading, split your WebGL buffer uploads like this:



ts

CopyEdit

function streamVertices(vertexStream: ReadableStream) {

  const reader = vertexStream.getReader();

  function pump() {

    return reader.read().then(({ done, value }) => {

      if (done) return;

      gpuVertexBuffer.appendChunk(value); // Custom ring buffer or FIFO queue

      return pump();

    });

  }

  return pump();

}

This ensures:



No GPU spike from massive .json/.glb loads

Can progressively render with vertex chunk metadata (LOD, regions, etc.)

Supports aborting on user interaction (via AbortController)

✅ Best Practices in SvelteKit 2 with XState

FeaturePurposeXStateDeclarative state machine that tracks stream status (INIT, BUFFERING, READY)SvelteKit load()Use +page.server.ts or load() with fetch() to begin streamsStore vertex stateUse $vertexChunks, Writable store to update WebGLGPU feedbackUse requestAnimationFrame() loop to monitor memory pressure and inform state transitionsBackpressure controlIf chunk render is slow, pause stream using reader.cancel() or controller.abort()



✅ Backend: Redis / NATS / ZeroMQ for Coordination

You need a low-latency, fire-and-forget backend for:

Architectural Blueprint for a Self-Evolving Legal AI Assistant
1. Executive Summary & Architectural Vision
This document provides a detailed technical blueprint for a next-generation, AI-powered legal case management application. The system is designed as a cross-platform desktop application that combines a highly reactive SvelteKit v2 frontend with a powerful, multi-faceted backend. The core of the system is a locally run Gemma 3 model, fine-tuned with Unsloth, that powers an Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. This pipeline leverages a unique combination of PostgreSQL with pg_vector, the high-performance Qdrant vector database, and a Neo4j knowledge graph to deliver contextually rich and accurate legal insights.

A cornerstone of this architecture is its ability to run natively on Windows with full GPU acceleration, achieved by leveraging a community-maintained, Windows-native build of OpenAI's Triton. This approach provides superior performance and stability compared to solutions requiring Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2).

The application's state is managed through a robust system that combines Svelte's global stores with a deterministic state machine, ensuring a fluid and predictable user experience. This "event machine" is designed around SvelteKit's "inverse relationship" philosophy—shifting computational work to compile time—and is augmented with server-side caching and debouncing to create a seamless, real-time feel. The system is designed to be proactive, learning from user interactions to evolve its knowledge base and even its own performance through AI-driven code optimization.

2. Core Architecture: The Reactive Event Machine
The application's architecture is built on a reactive, event-driven model that ensures the UI is always responsive and in sync with the underlying data state.

2.1. SvelteKit's Inverse Relationship and State Management
SvelteKit's core advantage is its compile-time reactivity, which surgically updates the DOM instead of relying on a heavy runtime virtual DOM. We leverage this "inverse relationship" for our state management.

Global Stores and SSR Safety: The application manages global state (like the logged-in user and the currently active case) using Svelte stores. To prevent data leakage between different user sessions during Server-Side Rendering (SSR), these stores are not defined in a globally shared module. Instead, they are instantiated within the root layout component and passed down through Svelte's context API. This ensures that each user request on the server gets its own isolated state instance.

SSR Hydration and Caching: The application uses SSR for fast initial page loads. To optimize performance for subsequent requests, a Redis cache is used on the server. The SvelteKit hooks.server.ts file intercepts incoming requests, checks Redis for a cached version of the page, and serves it directly if available. If not, the page is rendered, and the result is stored in Redis for future requests. This provides near-static site performance for dynamic content.

Debounced Events: User inputs that trigger API calls (like search queries) are debounced. This technique delays the function execution until a certain amount of time has passed without new input, preventing a flood of requests to the backend and reducing API rate limit issues.

3. The Enhanced RAG Pipeline: A Multi-Database Approach
To provide highly accurate and contextually aware answers, the system moves beyond simple vector search to a multi-modal retrieval pipeline orchestrated by LangChain.

3.1. Data Ingestion and Multi-Modal Indexing
The data layer is designed to capture both the semantic meaning and the structural relationships within legal documents.

PostgreSQL + pg_vector: This serves as the system's primary database. All uploaded evidence, case details, and Persons of Interest (POIs) are stored here. Using the Drizzle ORM, the application maintains strong data integrity. The 

pg_vector extension allows for storing vector embeddings directly alongside the structured data, ensuring transactional consistency.

Nomic Embeddings: LangChain will use the nomic-embed-text-v1 model to generate high-quality embeddings for all textual content. These embeddings are crucial for semantic search capabilities.

Qdrant for High-Performance Search: While pg_vector is excellent for integrated storage, Qdrant is used as a specialized, high-performance vector search engine. It is purpose-built in Rust and offers superior speed, better filtering capabilities, and more efficient memory usage, especially for the demanding tasks of auto-tagging evidence and powering the real-time recommendation engine.

Neo4j for Knowledge Graph: As documents are ingested, an LLM extracts key entities (POIs, dates, locations, legal precedents) and their relationships. This structured information is stored in a Neo4j graph database. This allows the system to answer complex, multi-hop questions that are impossible for a standard vector search, such as "Which POIs are linked to 'Case A' and have also been mentioned in evidence related to 'Case B'?".

3.2. Hybrid Retrieval with Real-Time PageRank
This architecture employs a dynamic, graph-based ranking system to enhance the relevance of retrieved information.

Hybrid Retrieval: When a user asks a question, LangChain initiates a three-pronged retrieval process:

Vector Search: Qdrant and pg_vector retrieve text chunks that are semantically similar to the query.

Keyword Search: PostgreSQL's full-text search finds exact matches for legal terms or names.

Graph Traversal: Neo4j identifies entities and relationships connected to the query's core concepts.

Real-Time PageRank: The results from these retrievers form a temporary, query-specific knowledge graph. A Personalized PageRank algorithm is then run on this graph. The initial query vector "personalizes" the ranking, biasing it towards the most relevant nodes.

Concurrent Feedback Loop: User interactions provide real-time feedback. When a user clicks on a retrieved document or marks a generated summary as helpful, that node in the graph receives a +1 score. If a result is ignored, it receives a -1. These scores act as weights in subsequent PageRank calculations, creating a concurrent, self-improving system that learns the user's preferences in real-time.

4. GPU Acceleration on Native Windows with Triton
A significant innovation of this architecture is achieving high-performance GPU acceleration on Windows natively, without the overhead and complexity of WSL2.

The woct0rdho/triton-windows Fork: This architecture specifies the use of the woct0rdho/triton-windows project, a community-maintained fork that provides a 100% Windows-native build of Triton. This build uses the native MSVC compiler and removes all POSIX dependencies, allowing tools like torch.compile and triton.jit to function directly on Windows. This is the recommended and most stable path for native Windows GPU acceleration with Triton.

LLM Serving Strategy:

Ollama for Development: For ease of use during development and prototyping, Ollama will be used. It provides a simple, one-command setup for running various LLMs, including Gemma 3, and has native Windows support with GPU acceleration.

Native Triton for Production: For the production application, a custom Python server will serve the Gemma 3 model using PyTorch, accelerated by the native Windows Triton backend. This provides maximum performance and control over the inference process. While vLLM does not have an official native Windows build, the community is actively working on it, and this architecture is positioned to adopt it once it becomes stable.

5. Application Data Model for Legal-AI
The application is designed around a clear and extensible data model that captures the core components of legal case management.

User: Manages authentication and user-specific settings.

Case: The central entity. Each case has a unique ID, a name, a status (e.g., Open, Pending, Closed), and other relevant metadata.

Person of Interest (POI): Represents any individual involved in a case (client, witness, opposing counsel, etc.). POIs are linked to one or more cases.

Evidence: Represents any document, image, or piece of text uploaded to the system. Each piece of evidence is linked to a specific case and can be associated with multiple POIs.

This relational structure is implemented in PostgreSQL, while the connections between these entities form the nodes and relationships in the Neo4j knowledge graph, enabling powerful, context-aware queries across the entire dataset.

This relational structure is implemented in PostgreSQL, while the connections between these entities form the nodes and relationships in the Neo4j knowledge graph, enabling powerful, context-aware queries across the entire dataset.

6. The Proactive & Self-Improving AI Assistant
This architecture moves beyond a reactive tool to create a proactive AI assistant designed to enhance user productivity and uncover critical insights autonomously. The assistant learns from user behavior and self-prompts actions, acting as an intelligent partner in case management.

6.1. Proactive Productivity and "Detective Mode"
The assistant is designed to anticipate user needs and surface hidden connections within the case data.

Self-Prompting Workflow Automation: The AI agent monitors user actions and environmental triggers (e.g., new document uploads, calendar events). Based on learned patterns, it proactively suggests next steps. For example, after a user adds a new POI to a case, the assistant might prompt: "I've added John Doe to the case. Would you like me to scan all existing evidence for mentions of his name?" This transforms the application from a passive repository into an active participant in the legal workflow.

"Detective Mode" for Evidence Analysis: This feature leverages the full power of the Enhanced RAG pipeline to discover non-obvious connections. When activated, it initiates a deep analysis by:

Traversing the Neo4j knowledge graph to find multi-hop relationships between evidence, POIs, and cases that would be missed by traditional queries.

Querying Qdrant and pg_vector to find semantically related documents that are not explicitly linked in the graph.

Applying the real-time PageRank algorithm to this combined dataset to rank and surface the most central and influential pieces of information, effectively highlighting the "smoking guns" in a complex case.

6.2. Client-Side Caching and Search
To ensure a fluid user experience, especially during intensive backend operations, the system utilizes client-side technologies for caching and searching.

Loki.js for In-Memory Caching: A client-side Loki.js instance is used as a fast, in-memory cache for frequently accessed but non-critical data, such as the list of cases or POIs for the current user. This allows the UI to remain responsive and display essential information even while the main RAG pipeline is processing a complex query.

Fuse.js for Instant Fuzzy Search: For client-side filtering, such as searching within a list of documents already loaded in the UI, Fuse.js provides instant, typo-tolerant fuzzy search capabilities without requiring a server round-trip.

6.3. The Self-Improving Feedback Loop
The assistant's proactive nature is the engine for its own improvement. Every interaction becomes a data point for learning.

Interaction as Feedback: When the assistant self-prompts an action (e.g., "Shall I summarize this new deposition?") and the user accepts, this is treated as positive reinforcement. If the user dismisses the suggestion, it's negative feedback.

Refining the PageRank: This +1/-1 feedback is fed directly into the real-time PageRank algorithm, continuously refining the weights of the knowledge graph and improving the relevance of future recommendations and "Detective Mode" results.

Enhancing the RAG Dataset: High-quality interactions, where the user positively engages with a suggestion, are used to generate new training data. For example, an accepted summarization task creates a new, validated (document, summary) pair that enriches the dataset used for ongoing knowledge distillation, making the underlying Gemma 3 model progressively more attuned to the user's specific needs.

6.4. Best Practices for a Proactive Legal AI
Implementing a proactive assistant in a sensitive domain like law requires strict adherence to best practices to ensure trust, reliability, and security.

Transparency and Explainability: Every proactive suggestion or "Detective Mode" insight must be accompanied by a clear explanation of its origin. For example: "I recommend reviewing Document B because it mentions a key witness from Document A." This allows the user to verify the AI's reasoning.

User in Control: The user must always have the ability to accept, reject, or ignore AI suggestions. The interface should be designed to be helpful but not intrusive, ensuring the user remains the ultimate decision-maker.

Data Privacy and Security: All proactive analysis is performed on the user's local machine. The system is architected with a privacy-first principle, ensuring that sensitive case data is never exposed to external services without explicit user consent.

Prioritizing Accuracy: In the legal field, accuracy is non-negotiable. The system must be configured to prioritize verifiable, explicit connections from the Neo4j knowledge graph over purely semantic similarities from the vector stores when presenting critical information.
