Check for typos in the config path:
Your drizzle.config.ts uses:


schema: './src/lib/db/schema.ts',
This matches the actual file path, so this is correct.

Check for multiple Drizzle configs:
Make sure you are running npm run db:push from the sveltekit-frontend directory, where the config and schema are present.

Check for Drizzle version mismatch:
If you recently upgraded Drizzle, try deleting the drizzle output folder and re-running the command.

Check for permission issues:
Make sure the file is not locked or restricted by your OS.

Try running with an explicit config path:
Run:


npx drizzle-kit push --config=drizzle.config.ts
or


npm run db:push -- --config=drizzle.config.ts
If using Windows, check for path separator issues:
Sometimes, Windows can have issues with forward vs. backward slashes. Try changing the schema path in drizzle.config.ts to:


schema: ".\\src\\lib\\db\\schema.ts",
or use path.resolve for cross-platform compatibility.

Summary:

Your schema file exists and is valid.
Try running the push command with an explicit config path.
If the error persists, try adjusting the schema path for Windows compatibility.
Would you like me to update your drizzle.config.ts to use a cross-platform path for the schema?
