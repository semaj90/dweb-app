   - Vector database for AI features

🚀 SvelteKit Dev Server: RUNNING (Port 5173)
   - Background process started
   - Development mode active
   - Frontend application accessible

🎛️ Drizzle Studio: RUNNING (Port 4983)
   - Database management interface

🎭 PLAYWRIGHT E2E TEST RESULTS
================================================================================
📊 Test Summary: 42 TOTAL FAILURES DETECTED
All test failures span across three browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)

❌ FAILED TEST CATEGORIES:

🔐 Authentication Tests (3 failures per browser = 9 total):
   - Registration flow failure
   - Login flow with demo user failure  
   - Invalid login credentials handling failure

🏥 Basic Health Tests (4 failures per browser = 12 total):
   - Homepage loading errors
   - Login page access issues
   - Register page access issues  
   - 404 page handling problems

📂 Case Management Tests (3 failures per browser = 9 total):
   - Cases page access failure
   - Case creation form access failure
   - Case creation flow failure

🔄 Complete E2E Tests (2 failures per browser = 6 total):
   - Full user journey failure (register → login → create case → upload evidence)
   - Database persistence verification failure

🗄️ Database Connection Tests (2 failures per browser = 6 total):
   - Database connection and table verification failure
   - API endpoint access failure

🔧 TECHNICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED
================================================================================

1. 🗄️ DATABASE MIGRATION PROBLEMS:
   - Missing _journal.json in migration meta directory
   - Drizzle schema path configuration issues
   - Schema file path resolution problems in drizzle.config.ts

2. 🌐 FRONTEND-BACKEND CONNECTIVITY:
   - API endpoint connection failures
   - Database persistence issues
   - Authentication flow breakdowns

3. ⚡ BROWSER COMPATIBILITY:
   - Consistent failures across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit
   - Suggests fundamental application issues rather than browser-specific problems

4. 🔀 INTEGRATION FAILURES:
   - Complete user journey broken
   - Case management functionality non-operational
   - Evidence upload process failing

💡 IMMEDIATE RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

🚨 CRITICAL (Fix Immediately):
1. Resolve database migration issues - regenerate missing _journal.json
2. Fix drizzle.config.ts schema path configuration
3. Verify database connectivity from SvelteKit application
4. Test basic API endpoint functionality manually

🔧 HIGH PRIORITY:
1. Debug authentication flow - check JWT token generation/validation
2. Verify case management API endpoints are responding correctly
3. Test file upload functionality for evidence
4. Check frontend routing and navigation

📋 MEDIUM PRIORITY:
1. Resolve Qdrant health check issues for AI features
2. Verify all environment variables are properly configured
3. Test production build process (npm run build)
4. Review error handling in critical user flows
