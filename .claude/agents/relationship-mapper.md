```json
{
  "cypherQueries": [
    "MERGE (p:Person {name: 'John Doe'}) SET p.age = 35...",
    "MATCH (p1:Person {name: 'John Doe'}), (p2:Person {name: 'Jane Smith'}) MERGE (p1)-[:KNOWS]->(p2)..."
  ],
  "nodesCreated": 3,
  "relationshipsCreated": 2,
  "conflicts": [
    {
      "type": "person_duplicate",
      "message": "John Doe already exists with different details",
      "resolution": "merged_details"
    }
  ],
  "success": true
}
```

## Neo4j Schema
- **Person**: name, age, address, phone, occupation, role, confidence
