 Can you embed legal-bert with ONNX and use Python 
  middleware?

  Yes. This is an excellent architecture. You would run      
  a separate FastAPI (Python) server. This server would      
  load your legal-bert.onnx model. Your main SvelteKit       
  backend would then make an API call to this FastAPI        
  service to get the specialized legal embeddings.

  Can you use AutoGen and host FastAPI concurrently with     
   the SvelteKit app?

  Yes. This is the standard microservice pattern. You        
  would run the SvelteKit app and the FastAPI app as two     
   separate processes. For development, you can use two      
  different terminal windows. For production, you use a      
  process manager like pm2 to run and manage both 
  services on your server.

  What is the role of zx, pm2, and all the go-* tools?       

  Think of them as specialized workers on an assembly        
  line:

  pm2: The factory manager. It starts, stops, and 
  monitors all your different services (Node.js, Python,     
   Go) to make sure they are running.

  zx: A specialized tool for writing simple scripts 
  (like build or deployment scripts) in JavaScript 
  instead of Bash.

  go-kratos, go-routine, go-simd, go-llama: These are        
  parts of your high-performance Go microservices. You       
  use Go for tasks that need extreme speed, like 
  low-level LLM math (go-simd) or managing concurrent        
  tasks efficiently (go-routine). Your SvelteKit or 
  Python services can make API calls to these Go 
  services when they need a task done very, very fast.        How to Use:

  1. Install dependencies:
  cd mcp && npm run install-deps
  2. Setup Ollama models:
  npm run setup-ollama
  3. Configure environment:
  export
  OLLAMA_EMBED_MODEL=nomic-embed-text
  export WATCH_FILES=true
  export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
  4. Start the server:
  npm start

> what does this use for semaantic 
  analysis? 🧠 Answering Your Architectural
   Questions
  Here's how your other ideas fit into this
   stack.

  Can we embed legal-bert via ONNX?

  Yes, absolutely. Instead of using 
  OllamaEmbeddings, you would create a 
  custom LangChain Embeddings class. This 
  class would use the onnx-runtime library 
  to load your legal-bert.onnx model and 
  implement the _embedQuery method. This 
  gives you highly specialized, fast, and 
  local embeddings.

  Can we add Python middleware 
  (FastAPI/Flask) with AutoGen?

  Yes. This is a standard microservice 
  architecture. You would run a separate 
  FastAPI (Python) server that handles 
  complex agentic workflows with AutoGen. 
  Your SvelteKit backend would then call 
  this Python service via an HTTP request, 
  just like it would call any other 
  external API.

  How do we run it all concurrently?

  You use a process manager. pm2 is the 
  standard for Node.js applications and can
   also manage Python scripts. You would 
  configure pm2 to start and monitor your 
  SvelteKit app, your FastAPI app, and any 
  Go services simultaneously. This is 
  perfect for production. For development, 
  you can just use separate terminal 
  windows.


  Think of these as specialized tools in 
  your toolbox:

  zx: A helper from Google to make writing 
  shell scripts in JavaScript easier. It's 
  useful for automation and build tasks.
  "go-kratos, elk, other" is better than zx
   and pm2. node.js cluster, 
  service_worker. nampi? nats? rabbitmq?
  What is the role of zx, go-kratos, 
  go-simd, etc.? then to gollama, with gpu 
  acceleration? enhanced rag, if detect or 
  needed, xstate?
  go-kratos, go-routine, go-simd, go-llama:
   These are all part of your Go-based 
  microservices. You use them for tasks 
  where performance is absolutely critical 
  (like SIMD-accelerated math or managing 
  low-level LLM operations). Your main 
  SvelteKit app communicates with these Go 
  services for those specific 
  high-performance jobs.

✻ Thinking…

  The user is asking about what the 
  enhanced Context7 server uses for 
  semantic analysis, and they're 
  referencing some architectural discussion
   about various technologies. They also 
  selected line 63 which shows "import { 
  Open" - this seems to be the same 
  truncated import issue we saw earlier.

  Looking at the enhanced server I created,
   it uses:

  1. Nomic-embed-text via Ollama for 
  semantic embeddings (768-dimensional)
  2. Auto-encoder neural network for 
  compression (768 → 256 dimensions)
  3. Cosine similarity for semantic search
  4. Embedding centrality for summarization

  The user is asking about various 
  technologies and how they fit together:
  - legal-bert via ONNX
  - Python middleware with AutoGen
  - Go services (go-kratos, go-simd, 
  gollama)
  - Process management (pm2 vs 
  alternatives)
  - Message queues (NATS, RabbitMQ)
  - Enhanced RAG systems

  I should explain what the current server 
  uses for semantic analysis and then 
  address their architectural questions 
  about integrating these other 
  technologies.

● 🧠 Semantic Analysis in Enhanced Context7
   Server

  The enhanced Context7 server uses
  multiple layers for semantic analysis:

  Current Semantic Analysis Stack:

  1. Primary Embeddings: nomic-embed-text
  via Ollama
    - 768-dimensional vectors
    - Optimized for general semantic
  understanding
    - Local inference (no API calls)
  2. Auto-Encoder Compression: Custom
  neural network
    - Compresses 768 → 256 dimensions
    - Preserves semantic relationships
    - 3x storage/transfer efficiency
  3. Similarity Algorithms:
    - Cosine similarity for semantic search
    - Embedding centrality for
  summarization
    - Metadata fusion for enhanced context
  4. Contextual Enhancement:
    - File metadata integration
  (complexity, language, structure)
    - Multi-modal embeddings (content +
  metadata)
    - Weighted combination (80% content,
  20% metadata)

  🔧 Architecture Integration Options

  Based on your questions, here's how to
  integrate advanced components:

  Legal-BERT via ONNX 🏛️

  // Replace NomicOllamaEmbeddings with 
  ONNX-based embeddings
  import * as ort from 'onnxruntime-node';

  class LegalBERTEmbeddings {
    constructor() {
      this.session = await ort.InferenceSes
  sion.create('./models/legal-bert.onnx');
    }

    async embedQuery(text) {
      const tokens = this.tokenize(text);
      const tensor = new
  ort.Tensor('int64', tokens, [1,
  tokens.length]);
      const results = await
  this.session.run({ input_ids: tensor });
      return Array.from(results.last_hidden
  _state.data);
    }
  }

  💡 Recommended Integration Strategy

  1. Phase 1: Current setup (Nomic-embed +

  2. Phase 2: Add Legal-BERT ONNX for
  specialized legal analysis
  3. Phase 3: Integrate Python AutoGen for
  complex reasoning
  4. Phase 4: Add Go services for
  performance-critical operations
  5. Phase 5: Message queues (NATS) for
  scalable coordination

  🔧 Quick Setup Commands

  # Install enhanced dependencies
  npm install onnxruntime-node
  @tensorflow/tfjs-node

  # Setup Python AutoGen service
  pip install autogen-agentchat fastapi
  uvicorn

  # Build Go SIMD services
  cd go-services && go build -tags=avx512
  ./...

  # Start coordinated services
  pm2 start ecosystem.config.js

  The current server provides a solid
  foundation that can be progressively
  enhanced with these specialized
  components as your semantic analysis
  needs become more sophisticated!

> never use docker Low-Priority Build/UI 
  Warnings: build.terserOptions  what is 
  this?
  Log Messages: build.terserOptions is 
  specified..., The 'immutable' option has 
  been deprecated..., Using on:input is 
  deprecated...

  Meaning: These are warnings from your 
  tools (Vite and Svelte). They are not 
  causing the crash but are advising you on
   modernizing your code. They are safe to 
  ignore for now while you fix the critical
   errors.

  Open your project's .env file.

  Verify that POSTGRES_USER and 
  POSTGRES_PASSWORD are correct for your 
  database instance. Fix any typos.

  Fix the Database Query:

  Go to the file 
  src/lib/server/search/vector-search.ts.

  Find the select query that is failing. It
   will look something like db.select({id, 
  title, description, metadata, ...}).

  Remove metadata from that query to match 
  your actual table schema.

  Enable a Working Embedding Model:

  As your notes say, you need a working 
  model. In a terminal, run the command: 
  ollama pull nomic-embed-text

  In your .env file, add or update this 
  line to tell LangChain.js which model to 
  use: EMBED_MODEL="nomic-embed-text"

  After these three fixes, your full 
  backend search (PostgreSQL -> API -> 
  SvelteKit) should start working.

  🧠 Answering Your Architectural Questions

  You're asking all the right questions 
  about building a sophisticated, 
  multi-part AI system. Here’s how it all 
  fits together.
Can you embed legal-bert with ONNX and 
  use Python middleware?

  Yes. This is an excellent architecture. 
  You would run a separate FastAPI (Python)
   server. This server would load your 
  legal-bert.onnx model. Your main 
  SvelteKit backend would then make an API 
  call to this FastAPI service to get the 
  specialized legal embeddings.

  Can you use AutoGen and host FastAPI 
  concurrently with the SvelteKit app?

  Yes. This is the standard microservice 
  pattern. You would run the SvelteKit app 
  and the FastAPI app as two separate 
  processes. For development, you can use 
  two different terminal windows. For 
  production, you use a process manager 
  like pm2 to run and manage both services 
  on your server.

  What is the role of zx, pm2, and all the 
  go-* tools?

  Think of them as specialized workers on 
  an assembly line:

  pm2: The factory manager. It starts, 
  stops, and monitors all your different 
  services (Node.js, Python, Go) to make 
  sure they are running.

  zx: A specialized tool for writing simple
   scripts (like build or deployment 
  scripts) in JavaScript instead of Bash.

  go-kratos, go-routine, go-simd, go-llama:
   These are parts of your high-performance
   Go microservices. You use Go for tasks 
  that need extreme speed, like low-level 
  LLM math (go-simd) or managing concurrent
   tasks efficiently (go-routine). Your 
  SvelteKit or Python services can make API
   calls to these Go services when they 
  need a task done very, very fast.

  The user is asking about several things:

  1. They don't want to use Docker 
  (explicitly stated "never use docker")
  2. They're asking about 
  build.terserOptions and some build 
  warnings
  3. They're sharing some log messages 
  about deprecated options
  4. They seem to be having 
  database/embedding issues based on the 
  context
  5. They want to understand the 
  architecture with various tools like pm2,
   zx, go-kratos, etc.

  Let me address these points clearly:

  1. The build.terserOptions warning - this
   is likely a Vite/build tool 
  configuration issue
  2. The database connection and embedding 
  model issues
  3. The architecture questions about 
  microservices without Docker

  I should focus on:
  - Explaining build.terserOptions
  - Fixing the immediate issues (database, 
  embeddings)
  - Explaining the microservice 
  architecture without Docker
  - How to coordinate services with pm2 
  instead of Docker

● 🔧 Build Warnings & Architecture (No 
  Docker)

  build.terserOptions Warning

  This warning appears in Vite 
  configuration when using outdated Terser
  (JavaScript minifier) options:

  // vite.config.js - Fix the warning
  export default defineConfig({
    build: {
      // OLD (causes warning):
      terserOptions: {
        compress: { drop_console: true }
      },

      // NEW (fix):
      minify: 'terser',
      terserOptions: {
        compress: {
          drop_console: true,
          drop_debugger: true
        }
      }
    }
  });

  Quick Fix for Current Issues:

  1. Database Connection Fix:
  # Check PostgreSQL credentials
  "C:\Program 
  Files\PostgreSQL\17\bin\psql.exe" -U
  postgres -h localhost -c "SELECT 
  version();"

  # Set correct environment variables
  set DATABASE_URL=postgresql://legal_admin
  :123456@localhost:5432/legal_ai_db
  set POSTGRES_USER=legal_admin
  set POSTGRES_PASSWORD=123456

  2. Fix Vector Search Schema:
  // src/lib/server/search/vector-search.ts
  // Remove 'metadata' from select if 
  column doesn't exist
  const results = await db.select({
    id: documents.id,
    title: documents.title,
    description: documents.description,
    // metadata: documents.metadata  // 
  Remove this line if column missing
  }).from(documents);

  3. Setup Working Embeddings:
  # Pull the embedding model
  ollama serve nomic-embed-text

  # Set environment variable
  set EMBED_MODEL=nomic-embed-text
  set OLLAMA_EMBED_MODEL=nomic-embed-text

  Tool Roles Explained

  Process Management:

  - PM2: Factory manager -
  starts/stops/monitors all services
  - Node.js Cluster: Horizontal scaling
  within Node.js processes
  - Service Workers: Browser-like
  background processing

  Build & Automation:

  - zx: Write build scripts in JavaScript
  instead of Bash
  - npm scripts: Standard Node.js task
  runner
  - PowerShell: Windows-native scripting

  High-Performance Layer:

  - go-kratos: Microservice framework (like
   Express for Go)
  - go-routine: Go's concurrency primitives
  - go-simd: SIMD-accelerated math
  operations
  - go-llama: Go wrapper for LLM operations

  Message Coordination:

  - NATS: Lightweight message queue
  (alternative to RabbitMQ)
  - HTTP APIs: Simple request/response
  - WebSockets: Real-time bidirectional
  communication

  Alternative to Docker: Native Windows 
  Stack

  # Native Windows setup script
  # install-native-stack.ps1

  # Install Node.js services
  npm install -g pm2 nodemon

  # Install Python services
  pip install fastapi uvicorn
  autogen-agentchat

  # Install Go services
  go install
  github.com/go-kratos/kratos/v2@latest

  # Setup Ollama
  ollama pull nomic-embed-text
  ollama pull gemma3-legal

  # Start coordinated services
  pm2 start ecosystem.config.js

  Development Workflow:

  # Terminal 1: SvelteKit Frontend
  cd sveltekit-frontend && npm run dev

  # Terminal 2: Context7 Server  
  cd mcp && npm start

  # Terminal 3: Python AutoGen
  cd python-autogen && uvicorn main:app
  --reload

  # Terminal 4: Go Services
  cd go-services && go run
  ./cmd/simd-server

  # Or use PM2 to manage all:
  pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
  pm2 monit  # Monitor all services

  This gives you the same microservice
  benefits as Docker but runs natively on
  Windows with PM2 coordination!
