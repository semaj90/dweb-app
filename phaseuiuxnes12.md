# NES-Style State Caching & AI-Driven UI/UX: Phase 12+ Architecture

## The Architectural Vision: NES-Era Efficiency Meets Modern AI

This document details how to combine NES-style sprite sheet animation principles with modern SvelteKit, AI, and graphics technologies for a next-generation, predictive, and hyper-efficient web application.

---

## 1. NES Sprite Sheets vs. Modern Fabric.js State Caching

- **NES Sprite Sheets:** Pre-drawn frames, rapidly swapped by the PPU using assembly code. All possible states/animations are precomputed and loaded instantly from memory.
- **Modern SvelteKit App:** "Sprite sheet" = Array of precomputed Fabric.js canvas JSON states, stored in Loki.js. Each state is a full snapshot of the canvas. Animation = Rapidly loading these JSON states into Fabric.js (`canvas.loadFromJSON()`), just like swapping sprite frames.

---

## 2. Implementation: NES-Style Animation with AI and Caching

### State Management (Svelte Stores + Loki.js)

- Svelte store (e.g., `canvasState`) holds the current animation state (`'idle'`, `'jump'`, etc.).
- Loki.js stores all possible JSON “frames” for each animation.

### Renderer (Fabric.js + Svelte)

- Svelte component listens to `canvasState`.
- When state changes, fetches the corresponding array of JSON frames from Loki.js and plays them in sequence.

### AI-Driven Prediction (Web Worker + Local LLM)

- Web Worker logs user actions to Loki.js (`userActivity` collection).
- Loads a compact LLM (e.g., transformers.js) to embed sequences of actions as vectors.
- Stores these vectors in a client-side vector DB (e.g., voy-search).
- When a new action occurs, the worker predicts the next likely animation and preloads its JSON frames into Loki.js.

### Service Worker: Caching & Hydration

- Intercepts fetches for animation data.
- If data is in Loki.js, serves instantly (offline-first).
- If not, fetches from backend, caches in Loki.js, and hydrates Svelte stores.
- Handles background sync to push user activity and new vectors to the backend (Postgres/pgvector).

### Fabric.js + WebGL Shaders

- Canvas objects are managed by Svelte stores.
- When an object is added/modified, its state is saved as a new “frame” in Loki.js.
- WebGL shaders (GLSL) can be applied to Fabric.js objects for GPU-accelerated effects, just like NES palette swaps or special effects.

## 3. NES Analogy Table

| Layer              | NES Analogy          | Modern Implementation                |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Animation Frames   | Sprite Sheet         | Array of Fabric.js JSON states       |
| State Switch       | PPU Pointer Change   | Svelte store + canvas.loadFromJSON() |
| Preloading         | ROM in Memory        | Loki.js + Service Worker             |
| Prediction         | None (deterministic) | Local LLM + Vector Search            |
| Dynamic Generation | Impossible           | LLM creates new JSON frame arrays    |
| Visual Effects     | Palette Swap         | Fabric.js + WebGL Shader             |

---

## 4. Advanced: Dynamic Animation Generation

- The local LLM can generate new animation sequences (JSON arrays) on the fly, based on learned user patterns.
- These are saved to Loki.js, expanding the “sprite sheet” dynamically—something the NES could never do!

---

## 5. How to Wire It Up in Your Stack

1. **Svelte Store**: Holds current animation state.
2. **Loki.js**: Stores all possible canvas states (frames).
3. **Web Worker**: Logs user actions, runs LLM, predicts next state, preloads frames.
4. **Service Worker**: Handles cache, offline, and background sync.
5. **Fabric.js**: Renders the canvas, loads frames, applies shaders.
6. **Backend (Postgres/pgvector)**: Stores global embeddings, syncs with client for long-term learning.

---

## 6. Result

- Animates instantly, even offline.
- Feels “alive” and predictive, thanks to local AI.
- Can generate new “moves” and effects based on user style.
- Is as efficient as NES games, but with the power of modern AI and graphics.

## 7. Example: Svelte Store + Animation Engine

```ts
// src/lib/stores/canvas.ts
import { writable } from "svelte/store";
export const canvasState = writable("idle");
```

```js
// Canvas.svelte
import { canvasState } from "$lib/stores/canvas";
import { lokiDB } from "$lib/db";
import { onMount } from "svelte";
import { fabric } from "fabric";

let canvas;
onMount(() => {
  canvas = new fabric.Canvas("c");
});

$: {
  const stateName = $canvasState;
  const animationFrames = lokiDB
    .getCollection("canvasStates")
    .findOne({ name: stateName });
  if (animationFrames) playAnimation(animationFrames.frames);
}

function playAnimation(frames) {
  let i = 0;
  const interval = setInterval(() => {
    if (i >= frames.length) return clearInterval(interval);
    canvas.loadFromJSON(frames[i], () => canvas.renderAll());
    i++;
  }, 1000 / 24);
}
```

## 8. SSR Hydration and Perceived Performance

- SvelteKit SSR delivers the initial canvas state.
- Service Worker hydrates Loki.js with the most-used "sprite sheets" for instant perceived performance.
- LLM pre-caches next likely states based on real-time user activity.

---

## 9. Next Steps

- Scaffold Svelte stores and Loki.js integration.
- Set up Web Worker for user activity logging and LLM prediction.
- Implement Service Worker for cache and sync.
- Integrate Fabric.js and WebGL shaders for advanced effects.
- Connect backend for global learning and sync.
