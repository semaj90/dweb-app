You've hit the nail on the head! The error message tells us that the pg_vector extension isn't installed
  in your main PostgreSQL directory.

  The easiest way to fix this is to download the pre-compiled files for Windows and copy them to the
  correct location. Here's how:

   1. Download the pg_vector Extension:
       * Click this link to go to the official download page for pg_vector on Windows: [pg_vector for
         Windows Releases](https://github.com/andreiramani/pgvector_pgsql_windows/releases)
       * Look for the latest release that is compatible with PostgreSQL 17. It will likely be named
         something like vector.vX.X.X-pg17.zip.
       * Download that .zip file.

   2. Extract the Files:
       * Find the .zip file you just downloaded (usually in your "Downloads" folder).
       * Right-click it and select "Extract All...".

   3. Copy the Extension Files:
       * Open the folder that was created when you extracted the files.
       * You will see a few files inside (like vector.control, and files in lib and share subdirectories).
       * Select all of these files and folders and copy them.
       * Now, navigate to your PostgreSQL installation directory. Based on the error message, it is:
          C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\17\
       * Go into the share\extension subfolder. The full path is:
          C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\17\share\extension
       * Paste the files you copied into this extension folder. You may need administrator permission to do
         this.

   4. Try Again in pgAdmin:
       * Go back to the pgAdmin Query Tool that is connected to your legal_ai_db database.
       * Run the command again:
   1         CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;

  This time, it should execute successfully because PostgreSQL will be able to find the control file it
  was looking for.

  Let me know as soon as you see the "Query returned successfully" message
