make sure unocss, what google gemini said, 7_21_25 svelte compontents, 

 looks like you've provided a comprehensive guide on setting up shadcn-svelte in a SvelteKit project. Your instructions are clear, concise, and cover all the essential steps.

Here's a slightly refined version of your guide, incorporating a bit more explanation for each step to help beginners understand the "why" behind the commands.

Setting up shadcn-svelte in SvelteKit
This guide will walk you through integrating shadcn-svelte, a collection of reusable UI components, into your SvelteKit application.

1. Create Your SvelteKit Project
First, you need a SvelteKit project. If you don't have one yet, you can create it using the official SvelteKit command-line interface (CLI). This command scaffolds a new project in a directory named my-app.

Bash

npx svelte-add@latest my-app
2. Add Tailwind CSS
shadcn-svelte is built on top of Tailwind CSS for styling. The easiest way to add Tailwind to your SvelteKit project is by using the svelte-add utility.

Bash

npx svelte-add@latest tailwindcss
This command will install the necessary dependencies and configure your project to use Tailwind CSS.

3. Configure Path Aliases (Optional)
Path aliases make it easier to import modules from common directories. By default, SvelteKit uses the $lib alias for the src/lib directory. If you want to use a different alias, like @, you need to configure it in your svelte.config.js file.

For example, to use @/* to point to src/lib/*:

svelte.config.js

JavaScript

import { vitePreprocess } from '@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte';

/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */
const config = {
  // ... other config
  preprocess: vitePreprocess(),

  kit: {
    // ... other config
    alias: {
      '@/*': './src/lib/*'
    }
  }
};

export default config;
4. Initialize shadcn-svelte
Now it's time to add shadcn-svelte to your project. Run the following command in your project's root directory:

Bash

npx shadcn-svelte@latest init
This command will prompt you with a few configuration questions to set up a components.json file. This file tells shadcn-svelte where to place new components and how to handle imports.

Here are the typical questions and recommended answers:

Which base color would you like to use? › Slate (This is the default and can be changed later).

Where is your global CSS file? › src/app.css (This file will be overwritten with shadcn-svelte's base styles).

Configure the import alias for lib: › $lib

Configure the import alias for components: › $lib/components

Configure the import alias for utils: › $lib/utils

5. Add Components
You're all set! Now you can start adding individual components to your project as you need them. For example, to add a Button component, run:

Bash

npx shadcn-svelte@latest add button
This command will add the necessary files for the Button component to your project, typically in src/lib/components/ui/button.

6. Use Your New Component
You can now import and use the component in your Svelte files.

src/routes/+page.svelte

Svelte

<script lang="ts">
  import { Button } from "$lib/components/ui/button";
</script>

<h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">My Awesome App</h1>

<Button>Click me</Button>
And that's it! You've successfully integrated shadcn-svelte into your SvelteKit project. You can now add and customize components as needed.






what if I have my own base css file, am using unocss, tailwind?



Show thinking
Excellent question. This is a common scenario for developers who have an established project with their own styling conventions or prefer using a different atomic CSS engine like UnoCSS.

Here’s how you can handle this setup. The key is to let shadcn-svelte create its necessary theme file without overwriting your primary CSS file, and then configure UnoCSS to understand Tailwind's utility classes.

Summary of the Strategy
Protect Your Base CSS: During the init step, you'll point shadcn-svelte to a new, non-existent file for its theme configuration. This prevents it from overwriting your existing CSS.

Extract CSS Variables: You will modify this newly created file to keep only the CSS variables (:root) that shadcn-svelte needs for theming.

Configure UnoCSS: You'll use the UnoCSS Tailwind Preset to ensure it can generate the styles required by the shadcn-svelte components.

Import the Theme: You'll import the shadcn-svelte theme variables into your project.

Step-by-Step Guide
1. Run the init Command
Start the initialization process as usual:

Bash

npx shadcn-svelte@latest init
2. Configure components.json (The Important Part)
When the CLI asks for the location of your global CSS file, do not give it your existing file (src/app.css or similar). Instead, provide a path to a new file that will be created specifically for shadcn-svelte's theme.

A good practice is to place it within your src/lib directory.

Plaintext

Which base color would you like to use? › Slate
Where is your global CSS file? (this file will be overwritten) › src/lib/styles/theme.css  <-- PROVIDE A NEW PATH HERE
Configure the import alias for lib: › $lib
Configure the import alias for components: › $lib/components
# ...and so on
3. Clean Up the New Theme File
The init command will create the src/lib/styles/theme.css file with the following content:

CSS

/* src/lib/styles/theme.css */

@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

@layer base {
  :root {
    --background: 0 0% 100%;
    --foreground: 222.2 84% 4.9%;
    /* ... many other color and style variables */
    --radius: 0.5rem;
  }

  .dark {
    /* ... dark theme variables */
  }
}
Since you are using UnoCSS, you do not need the @tailwind directives. Your UnoCSS setup should already be handling the injection of base styles (like a CSS reset).

Action: Edit src/lib/styles/theme.css and remove the @tailwind directives. You only need to keep the layer with the CSS variables.

Your cleaned-up file should look like this:

CSS

/* src/lib/styles/theme.css */

@layer base {
  :root {
    --background: 0 0% 100%;
    --foreground: 222.2 84% 4.9%;
    /* ... many other color and style variables */
    --radius: 0.5rem;
  }

  .dark {
    /* ... dark theme variables */
  }
}
4. Configure UnoCSS for Tailwind Compatibility
The components you add from shadcn-svelte are written with Tailwind CSS utility classes. To make them work, you must configure UnoCSS to recognize and process those classes using the Tailwind Preset.

Install the preset:

Bash

npm install -D @unocss/preset-tailwind
Update your UnoCSS config (uno.config.ts):
Import presetTailwind and add it to your presets array.

TypeScript

// uno.config.ts
import { defineConfig, presetUno } from 'unocss';
import presetTailwind from '@unocss/preset-tailwind';

export default defineConfig({
  presets: [
    presetUno(), // Your other presets
    presetTailwind() // Add the Tailwind preset
  ],
  // ... your other UnoCSS configurations
});
This preset makes UnoCSS compatible with most Tailwind utilities, colors, and variants.

5. Import the Theme Variables
Finally, import the theme.css file you created into a global entry point, such as your root layout file. This ensures the --background, --primary, --radius, etc., variables are available everywhere.

src/routes/+layout.svelte

Svelte

<script>
  import "$lib/styles/theme.css";
  import "../app.css"; // Your main CSS file
</script>

<slot />
What about the tailwind-merge utility?
shadcn-svelte components rely on a helper utility that uses tailwind-merge to intelligently combine CSS classes. Since the UnoCSS Tailwind preset generates classes that mimic Tailwind's, tailwind-merge will work correctly in almost all cases. You don't need to do anything extra for this.

By following these steps, you can successfully integrate shadcn-svelte into your project without disrupting your existing UnoCSS workflow or overwriting your custom styles.

How to manage the state of Bits UI components



This is a documentation section that potentially contains examples, demos, and other useful information related to a specific part of Bits UI. When helping users with this documentation, you can ignore the classnames applied to the demos unless they are relevant to the user's issue.



State management is a critical aspect of modern UI development. Bits UI components support multiple approaches to manage component state, giving you flexibility based on your specific needs.



Each component's API reference will highlight what props are `bindable`. You can replace the `value` prop used in the examples on this page with any `bindable` prop.



## Two-Way Binding



The simplest approach is using Svelte's built-in two-way binding with `bind:`:



```svelte

<script lang="ts">

  import { ComponentName } from "bits-ui";

  let myValue = $state("default-value");

</script>

<button onclick={() => (myValue = "new-value")}> Update Value </button>

<ComponentName.Root bind:value={myValue}></ComponentName.Root>

```



### Why Use It?



- Zero-boilerplate state updates  

- External controls work automatically  

- Great for simple use cases ## Function Binding



For complete control, use a [Function Binding](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/bind#Function-bindings) that handles both getting and setting values:



```svelte

<script lang="ts">

  import { ComponentName } from "bits-ui";

  let myValue = $state("default-value");

  function getValue() {

    return myValue;

  }

  function setValue(newValue: string) {

    // Only update during business hours

    const now = new Date();

    const hour = now.getHours();

    if (hour >= 9 && hour <= 17) {

      myValue = newValue;

    }

  }

</script>

<ComponentName.Root bind:value={getValue, setValue}></ComponentName.Root>

```



When the component wants to set the value from an internal action, it will invoke the setter, where you can determine if the setter actually updates the state or not.



### When to Use



- Complex state transformation logic  

- Conditional updates  

- Debouncing or throttling state changes  

- Maintaining additional state alongside the primary value  

- Integrating with external state systems

merging props using bits-ui v 2




Show thinking
Of course. Here's an explanation of the Bits UI state management documentation you provided, with additional context on prop merging.

This documentation explains how you can control the internal state of Bits UI components from outside the component itself. Think of it like controlling a light switch from different places in a room. Bits UI gives you a couple of ways to do this, depending on how simple or complex your needs are.

A key concept is that some component properties (props) are "bindable." This means you can connect them to your own variables to read their value or change it.

Two-Way Binding
This is the most straightforward method, using Svelte's native bind: directive. It creates a direct, two-way link between your variable and the component's internal state.

How it works:
In the example, myValue is your variable.

Svelte

<script lang="ts">
  import { ComponentName } from "bits-ui";
  let myValue = $state("default-value"); // Your variable
</script>

<button onclick={() => (myValue = "new-value")}> Update </button>

<ComponentName.Root bind:value={myValue}></ComponentName.Root>
If you change myValue (like with the button click), the ComponentName automatically updates.

If the ComponentName changes its own value internally (e.g., a user types into an input field within the component), your myValue variable automatically gets that new value.

When to use it:
This method is perfect for simple situations where you just need to keep a variable and a component in sync without any fuss. It’s clean, simple, and requires no extra code.

Function Binding
This is a more advanced technique for when you need to run some logic before a state change happens. Instead of linking directly to a variable, you link to a pair of functions: one to get the value, and one to set it.

How it works:
You provide two functions: a "getter" and a "setter."

Svelte

<script lang="ts">
  import { ComponentName } from "bits-ui";
  let myValue = $state("default-value");

  // Getter: The component calls this when it needs to know the current value.
  function getValue() {
    return myValue;
  }

  // Setter: The component calls this when it *wants* to change the value.
  function setValue(newValue: string) {
    // You can add your own rules here!
    const hour = new Date().getHours();
    if (hour >= 9 && hour <= 17) { // Only allow updates during business hours
      myValue = newValue;
    }
  }
</script>

<ComponentName.Root bind:value={{ a: getValue, b: setValue }}></ComponentName.Root>
When the component needs to update its state, it calls your setValue function with the proposed new value. This gives you a chance to intercept the change and decide if it should go through, or maybe even modify the value before setting it.

When to use it:
This approach is ideal for complex scenarios, such as:

Validation: Preventing certain values from being set.

Conditional Updates: Only allowing changes if certain conditions are met (like in the "business hours" example).

Throttling/Debouncing: Delaying updates to prevent too many changes from happening too quickly.

External Stores: Syncing the component's state with a more complex state management library (like a Svelte store).

Merging Props in Bits UI
The documentation you provided focuses on state, but a related and very important concept in Bits UI is how to handle HTML attributes and other props. Often, you want to add your own attributes (like a class, id, or data-testid) to a component while preserving the attributes and event handlers that Bits UI adds internally.

Bits UI provides a special utility called a "builder" for this. The component part returns a builder object (e.g., root, trigger, content), and you use the spread attribute syntax ({... }) to apply its properties to your HTML element.

Here's how you would merge your own props with Bits UI's props:

Svelte

<script lang="ts">
    import { Popover } from "bits-ui";
</script>

<Popover.Root>
    <Popover.Trigger
        {...$$props} class="my-custom-class {$$props.class || ''}" data-testid="my-popover-trigger" onmousedown={(e) => console.log("My custom event!")} >
        Open
    </Popover.Trigger>
    <Popover.Content>
        </Popover.Content>
</Popover.Root>
By spreading $$props ({...$$props}), you apply all the necessary accessibility attributes and event listeners that Bits UI has prepared. Then, you can safely add your own on top of them. For classes, the common pattern is to merge your custom class with any class that might be passed into the component, as shown with class="my-custom-class {$$props.class || ''}".






with sveltekit v2 best practices, do we use a barrel store .ts for state change global ui? postgresql, drizzle-orm, xstate, loki.js etc? how does this merging props works?

superform with multiple schemas, ssr hydration




Show thinking
For managing global UI state in a modern SvelteKit v2 project, using a barrel file (index.ts) to export your Svelte stores is a clean and common practice, but not a strict necessity. It's more of a code organization strategy. The core best practice is using Svelte's built-in stores for your global state.

When you have multiple related stores for UI state (e.g., isSidebarOpen, activeTheme, notificationMessage), grouping them in a directory like /src/lib/stores and exporting them from a single index.ts barrel file simplifies imports. Instead of multiple import lines, you get one clean line.

TypeScript

// Instead of this:
import { isSidebarOpen } from '$lib/stores/sidebar';
import { activeTheme } from '$lib/stores/theme';

// You can do this:
import { isSidebarOpen, activeTheme } from '$lib/stores';
Regarding your stack, here’s how these technologies fit together with best practices:

State Management (UI):

Svelte Stores: The default and idiomatic choice for most global state in SvelteKit. They are simple, reactive, and built-in.

XState: Use this for complex, multi-step UI components like a multi-stage form, a shopping cart, or a complex navigation menu. It's overkill for simple state like a theme toggle, but invaluable for preventing bugs in stateful logic. You would typically use XState within a specific component or a related set of components, and you can still sync its final state back to a global Svelte store if needed.

Data & Persistence:

PostgreSQL & Drizzle ORM: This is your primary, persistent database setup. You'll use this in your server-side code (+page.server.ts, +server.ts) to load, create, and update your application's core data.

Loki.js: This is an in-memory database. Its best use case is for temporary or cached server-side data that needs to be queried quickly without hitting your main PostgreSQL database. For example, you could cache session data or frequently accessed product information. It is not for client-side state.

You wouldn't typically use PostgreSQL or Loki.js for managing a UI component's state (like whether a dropdown is open). That's what Svelte stores and XState are for.

How Prop Merging Works
Prop merging is essential when using "headless" UI libraries or component patterns (like Bits UI or your own custom components) where you need to add your own attributes (like CSS classes) to an element without overriding the library's essential props.

The most common pattern uses Svelte's $$props and $$restProps combined with a utility like tailwind-merge.

Let's say you have a Button component that needs its own base classes but should also accept extra classes from where it's used.

Inside your component (/src/lib/components/Button.svelte):

Svelte

<script lang="ts">
  import { twMerge } from 'tailwind-merge';
  let { class: extraClass = '', ...rest } = $$props;

  // Base classes for the button
  const baseClass = 'font-semibold py-2 px-4 rounded';

  // Merge the base classes with any extra classes passed in
  const mergedClass = twMerge(baseClass, extraClass);
</script>

<button class={mergedClass} {...rest}>
  <slot />
</button>
How you use it:

Svelte

<Button class="bg-blue-500 text-white hover:bg-blue-700">
  Click Me
</Button>
Here's the breakdown of how it works:

$$props: This special Svelte object contains all props passed to the component, including ones you didn't explicitly declare with export let.

let { class: extraClass = '', ...rest } = $$props;: This line does two things:

It extracts the class prop into a variable named extraClass.

The ...rest captures all other props (type, disabled, data-testid, etc.) into an object called rest.

twMerge(baseClass, extraClass): tailwind-merge is a crucial utility that intelligently combines Tailwind CSS classes. It handles conflicts gracefully (e.g., if you pass p-2 and the base class has p-4, it knows which one should take precedence) and removes redundancies.

{...rest}: This is the Svelte spread syntax. It applies all the other attributes from the rest object directly onto the <button> element. This is how type="submit" or a disabled attribute gets passed through.

Superforms with Multiple Schemas & SSR
Superforms is excellent at handling complex forms, including those that might involve multiple validation schemas (e.g., a multi-step wizard where each step has its own validation rules).

The key to managing this with SSR hydration is to determine the active schema on the server and pass down the correct form object to the client.

Here's a simplified strategy for a multi-step form:

1. Define Your Schemas:
Use Zod to define a schema for each step of your form.

TypeScript

// src/lib/schemas.ts
import { z } from 'zod';

export const step1Schema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(2),
});

export const step2Schema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email(),
});

export const allSchemas = [step1Schema, step2Schema];
2. Server-Side Logic (+page.server.ts):
In your load function and form actions, you need logic to determine the current step and use the corresponding schema.

TypeScript

// src/routes/wizard/+page.server.ts
import { superValidate } from 'sveltekit-superforms';
import { zod } from 'sveltekit-superforms/adapters';
import { allSchemas } from '$lib/schemas';

export const load = async ({ url }) => {
  const step = Number(url.searchParams.get('step')) || 0;
  const schema = allSchemas[step];

  const form = await superValidate(zod(schema));
  return { form, step };
};

export const actions = {
  default: async ({ request }) => {
    const formData = await request.formData();
    const step = Number(formData.get('step')) || 0;
    const schema = allSchemas[step];

    const form = await superValidate(formData, zod(schema));

    // Handle form validation and data submission...
    // Redirect to the next step, etc.

    return { form };
  },
};
3. Client-Side Component (+page.svelte):
The component receives the correct form instance for the current step directly from the data prop. Superforms handles the hydration automatically. You can use the step variable to conditionally show the fields for the current part of the form.

Svelte

<script lang="ts">
  export let data;

  const { form, errors, enhance } = superForm(data.form);
</script>

<form method="POST" use:enhance>
  <input type="hidden" name="step" value={data.step} />

  {#if data.step === 0}
    <label for="name">Name</label>
    <input type="text" name="name" bind:value={$form.name} />
    {#if $errors.name}<span class="error">{$errors.name}</span>{/if}
  {/if}

  {#if data.step === 1}
    <label for="email">Email</label>
    <input type="email" name="email" bind:value={$form.email} />
    {#if $errors.email}<span class="error">{$errors.email}</span>{/if}
  {/if}

  <button type="submit">
    {#if data.step < allSchemas.length - 1}Next{:else}Submit{/if}
  </button>
</form>
This approach works perfectly with SSR because the server always sends the client the exact form object it needs for the current state. When the client-side Svelte code runs, superForm initializes with the server-rendered data, ensuring a seamless and flicker-free hydration.

api json calls from user session? global ui? session global store is subscribed to? is user signed in or not? cookie present? etc?



Show thinking
Yes, you can and should use a global, subscribable store in SvelteKit to manage the user's session status. This store is populated with data that originates from a secure, server-side check of a user's cookie. Here's a breakdown of how it all works together.

How it Works: From Cookie to Global UI
The process involves both the server and the client working in tandem:

The Cookie: When a user signs in, your server creates a session and sends a secure, httpOnly cookie back to the browser. This cookie contains a session ID, not the user's actual data.

Server-Side Check: For every request to your SvelteKit app, a server-side hook (src/hooks.server.ts) runs first. This hook checks for the session cookie. If the cookie is present, the server uses the session ID to retrieve the user's data (e.g., from a database). This user data is then attached to event.locals, a secure object available only on the server.

Loading Data: Next, your root layout's server-side load function (src/routes/+layout.server.ts) runs. It reads the user data from event.locals and returns it. This makes the user data available to all pages.

The Global Store: The data from the load function is automatically passed to the $page store, which is a built-in, readable store in SvelteKit. Any part of your UI can subscribe to $page.data.user to reactively update when the user's sign-in status changes.

Making API Calls with the User's Session
When you need to make an API call from the client-side that requires authentication, you don't need to manually handle the session cookie. You can simply make a fetch request to your app's own API endpoints (e.g., /api/profile). Because the browser automatically includes the session cookie with the request, your server-side API route can then verify the user's session in the same way the hooks do.

Here's an example of an API endpoint that retrieves the current user's data:

TypeScript

// src/routes/api/user/+server.ts
import { json } from '@sveltejs/kit';

export async function GET({ locals }) {
  // locals.user was populated by your server hook
  if (!locals.user) {
    return json({ error: 'Not authenticated' }, { status: 401 });
  }

  return json({ user: locals.user });
}
The Global UI Store in Practice
You don't need to create a custom writable store for the user's session. The built-in $page store is the recommended way to access this data on the client.

Here's how you'd use it in a component to show different UI elements based on the user's sign-in status:

Svelte

<script>
  import { page } from '$app/stores';
</script>

<nav>
  {#if $page.data.user}
    <span>Welcome, {$page.data.user.name}!</span>
    <a href="/logout">Sign Out</a>
  {:else}
    <a href="/login">Sign In</a>
  {/if}
</nav>

<main>
  <slot />
</main>
Because your entire UI is subscribed to the $page store, everything updates automatically when the user signs in or out. For example, after a successful sign-in, you would typically redirect the user, which causes SvelteKit to re-run the relevant load functions, updating $page.data with the new user information and seamlessly updating the UI.







then explain layout using this setup, xstate with sveltekit v2 best practices, do we use a barrel store .ts for state change global ui? postgresql, drizzle-orm, xstate, loki.js etc? how does this merging props works?

superform with multiple schemas, ssr hydration and bits-ui, unocss, melt-ui, etc




Show thinking
Your tech stack combines some of the most powerful tools in the Svelte ecosystem for building robust, modern web applications. Here’s a breakdown of how to structure your layout, manage state, and handle forms and props using these tools, aligned with SvelteKit v2 best practices.

Layouts and Global Data
In SvelteKit, the layout is the core of your app's structure and global data management.

Your primary layout files are in src/routes/:

+layout.svelte: This is the master component that wraps every page. It's where you'll put your persistent UI elements like a navbar, sidebar, or footer. It contains the <slot /> element, which is where the content of individual pages or nested layouts will be rendered.

+layout.server.ts: This file runs only on the server. Its load function is perfect for fetching sensitive or global data that every page needs. A key best practice is to load the user's session status here by verifying their cookie.

+layout.ts: This file can run on both the server and the client. Its load function is for fetching non-sensitive global data. It can also access data returned from the server load function.

How it all connects:

A user requests a page.

Your +layout.server.ts runs, checks the cookie, and fetches the user's data from PostgreSQL using Drizzle ORM.

This user data is returned from the load function.

The +layout.svelte component receives this data through the $page.data store.

Now, every component in your app can access $page.data.user to know if a user is signed in, without needing a separate global store for session data.

State Management: XState and Svelte Stores
For managing global UI state, you have a powerful combination.

Svelte Stores (The Default Choice): For simple global state (e.g., isSidebarOpen, theme), Svelte's built-in stores are the best practice. They are simple, reactive, and perfectly integrated into the framework.

Barrel Files (/stores/index.ts): Yes, using a barrel file is a great organizational practice. It allows you to group related stores and simplify imports throughout your app. Instead of import { storeA } from '$lib/stores/storeA' and import { storeB } from '$lib/stores/storeB', you can have a single, clean import: import { storeA, storeB } from '$lib/stores'.

XState (For Complex Logic): You should use XState when you have a component or feature with multiple, complex states and defined transitions. Think of a multi-step form, a shopping cart, or a video player. XState prevents you from writing messy if/else statements and ensures your component can only be in valid states. You would typically create and use a state machine within a specific component, not necessarily for all global state.

Loki.js (In-Memory Database): Loki.js is an in-memory database and should be used sparingly on the server-side. It's useful for caching frequently accessed data that doesn't change often, reducing the load on your main PostgreSQL database. It is not for managing client-side UI state.

Prop Merging with Bits-UI, Melt-UI, and UnoCSS
Headless UI libraries like Bits-UI and Melt-UI give you unstyled but accessible and functional component parts. Merging your own props (especially CSS classes from UnoCSS) is a crucial skill.

The core principle is to use the builder pattern provided by these libraries along with Svelte's spread attributes.

Example with Melt-UI:

Svelte

<script lang="ts">
  import { createDialog, melt } from '@melt-ui/svelte';
  import { twMerge } from 'tailwind-merge'; // Essential for combining UnoCSS/Tailwind classes

  const {
    elements: { trigger, overlay, content, title },
    states: { open }
  } = createDialog();

  // Your custom classes
  const customTriggerClass = 'bg-blue-500 text-white rounded p-2';
</script>

<button
  use:melt={$trigger}
  class={twMerge(customTriggerClass, $$props.class)}
>
  Open Dialog
</button>

{#if $open}
  <div use:melt={$overlay} class="fixed inset-0 bg-black/50" />
  <div use:melt={$content} class="fixed top-1/2 left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 bg-white p-6 rounded-lg">
    <h2 use:melt={$title} class="text-xl font-bold">Dialog Title</h2>
    <p>This is the dialog content.</p>
  </div>
{/if}
How it works:

Builder (melt or bits): The use:melt={$trigger} action applies all the necessary ARIA attributes and event listeners to the button.

$$props.class: This allows you to pass in additional classes from wherever you use this component.

twMerge: This utility is vital. It intelligently merges your custom classes with any passed-in classes, resolving conflicts and removing redundancies. This is how you reliably apply UnoCSS styles.

Superforms with Multiple Schemas and SSR
Superforms is designed for this exact scenario. You can handle complex, multi-step forms with different validation schemas while maintaining seamless Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and hydration.

The Strategy:

Define Schemas: Use a library like Zod to define a separate schema for each step of your form.

Server-Side Logic (+page.server.ts):

In your load function, determine the current step (usually from a URL search parameter, like ?step=2).

Use superValidate with the schema for that specific step.

Return the form object and the current step number to the client.

Client-Side Component (+page.svelte):

The page receives the correct form instance for the current step via the data prop.

Use an {#if} block to conditionally render the form fields for the current data.step.

Superforms automatically handles the hydration, so there's no flicker or loss of state. The form on the client is perfectly in sync with what the server rendered.

This approach ensures that validation is always handled by the correct schema on the server, and the UI updates reactively and correctly on the client.
