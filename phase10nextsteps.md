# Phase 10: Next Steps for Context7 Full-Stack Integration

## Advanced Integration & Automation TODOs

1. **Integrate semantic_search-driven pipeline validation**
   - [ ] Wire up semantic_search utility or API in backend (see synthesis-todo.ts)
   - [ ] Scan codebase for missing features, errors, and best practices
   - [ ] Auto-generate actionable TODOs and fixes for each pipeline step
2. **Automate TODO logging and error tracking**
   - [ ] Log semantic_search results to a todo log (phase10-todo.log or DB)
   - [ ] Suggest next steps and code improvements based on search results
3. **UI: Display pipeline audit results and recommended actions**
   - [ ] Scaffold Svelte component to visualize audit results and TODOs (e.g., AuditResults.svelte)
   - [ ] Connect to backend audit API for live updates
   - [ ] Implement shadcn-svelte design system patterns consistently
   - [ ] Apply UnoCSS maintainable styling practices
   - [ ] Add proper accessibility features to components
   - [ ] Provide clear feedback for AI operations
   - [ ] Ensure responsive design across all devices
   - [ ] Implement proper loading states
   - [ ] Use progressive enhancement patterns
   - [ ] Follow legal industry UX patterns
4. **Backend: Expose audit API endpoint for frontend consumption**
   - [ ] Implement /api/audit/semantic endpoint to run semantic_search and return results (see synthesis-todo.ts)
   - [ ] Return structured results for UI and agent consumption
5. **Agent Orchestration: Use audit results to trigger agent actions (CrewAI, Autogen)**
   - [ ] Feed TODOs and errors to agents for automated code review, fixes, and analysis
   - [ ] Implement agent triggers for code review, fix suggestions, and summary generation

## Full Stack Pipeline Checklist

- [ ] Backend: PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM + pgvector (schema, migrations, helpers)
- [ ] Async Jobs: Redis + RabbitMQ (worker, queue, pub/sub)
- [ ] RAG Pipeline: LangChain.js, PGVector, Qdrant (embedding, search, reranker)
- [ ] Graph Reasoning: Neo4j + GraphQL (schema, Cypher, API)
- [ ] Agent Orchestration: CrewAI + Autogen (personas, triggers, scripts)
- [ ] Frontend Cache: Loki.js + Fuse.js (SSR hydration, fuzzy search)
- [ ] UI/UX: SvelteKit 2, XState, UnoCSS, Bits UI (SPA, state, styling, components)
- [ ] Predictive Prefetching: Service Worker + LLM (prefetch, user intent)
- [ ] Error Handling & Logging (boundaries, guards, todo log)
- [ ] Integration Testing & Metrics (tests, metrics, feedback)

## Best Practices

- Use `context7-phase8-integration.ts` for unified recommendation system
- Integrate MCP server for best practices, stack analysis, and error handling
- Use `semantic_search` to validate pipeline, discover missing features, and auto-generate next steps
- Log errors and lost relevance to todo log
- Automate agent actions for code review and fixes

### Quick Scaffolds & Integration Points

- [ ] **Backend**: Add `/api/audit/semantic` endpoint (Node/SvelteKit)
- [ ] **UI**: Create `AuditResults.svelte` to display audit and TODOs
- [ ] **Agent**: Add agent trigger logic in backend (CrewAI/Autogen integration)
- [ ] **Logging**: Write semantic_search results to `phase10-todo.log` or DB

See `synthesis-todo.ts` for stub/mock functions and integration examples.
