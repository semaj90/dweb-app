# Node.js Debugger Issue - PERMANENT FIX

## Problem
All npm commands are stuck with debugger messages:
```
Debugger listening on ws://127.0.0.1:61436/...
Debugger attached.
```

## Cause
Your Node.js environment has debugging enabled by default, causing all processes to start with debugger attached.

## Solutions

### **Option 1: Quick Fix (Recommended)**
Run this before any npm command:
```cmd
set NODE_OPTIONS= && set NODE_INSPECT= && npm run check:direct
```

### **Option 2: Use the Batch File**
```cmd
disable-debugger.bat
```

### **Option 3: Environment Variable Fix**
Add these to your system environment variables:
- `NODE_OPTIONS` = (empty)
- `NODE_INSPECT` = (empty)
- `NODE_DEBUG` = (empty)

### **Option 4: Updated npm Scripts**
Use the new debugger-safe commands:
```cmd
npm run check:direct     # Fast confirmation check works
npm run check:ultra-fast # TypeScript check without debugger
npm run check:full       # Complete checking without debugger
```

## Test the Fix
```cmd
# Should work instantly without debugger
npm run check:direct

# Should run TypeScript check without hanging
npm run check:ultra-fast
```

## Permanent Solution
To fix this system-wide, check your:
1. Windows environment variables for Node debugging settings
2. `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` files (if using WSL/Git Bash)
3. VS Code settings that might auto-enable debugging
4. Global npm configuration

The debugger hanging issue is now resolved with these updated commands.
