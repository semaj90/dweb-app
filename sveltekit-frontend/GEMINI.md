# Gemini To-Do List: Legal AI Platform

*This document is the active to-do list for stabilizing and enhancing the Legal AI Platform. It is based on the architecture and goals outlined in `copilot.md`, which should be used as the primary architectural reference.*

---

**Phase 1: Environment and Tooling Setup**
1.  [ ] **Verify Native Environment:** Ensure Node.js, Go, and PostgreSQL are correctly installed and configured as native Windows services.
2.  [ ] **Implement Modern Scripting:**
    *   [ ] Install and configure Google's `zx` for writing shell scripts in TypeScript.
    *   [ ] Install and configure `pm2` for managing Node.js processes.
3.  [ ] **Migrate Scripts:** Convert the existing `.bat` and `.ps1` scripts to `zx` scripts for a unified and modern workflow.

---

**Phase 2: Context7 MCP Integration**
1.  [ ] **Deploy MCP Server:** Configure and launch the multi-core Context7 MCP server (`context7-mcp-server-multicore.js`) using `pm2`.
2.  [ ] **Integrate Go Microservices:** Implement the protobuf-based Go microservice to fetch and manage the Context7 MCP configuration and documentation files.
3.  [ ] **Implement Caching:** Implement the 7-layer caching architecture as described in `MCP_CONTEXT7_BEST_PRACTICES.md`.
4.  [ ] **Orchestrate Agents:** Implement the agent orchestration workflows using the patterns from `MCP_CONTEXT7_BEST_PRACTICES.md`.

---

**Phase 3: Database and Data**
1.  [ ] **Schema and Migrations:** Finalize the Drizzle schema and run migrations against the native PostgreSQL database.
2.  [ ] **Vector Embeddings:** Ensure the `pg_vector` extension is enabled and utilized for vector embeddings.
3.  [ ] **Data Seeding:** Validate and run the `seed.ts` and `seed-enhanced.ts` scripts to populate the database.

---

**Phase 4: Backend and API**
1.  [ ] **API Review:** Review and test all API endpoints, including the Go microservices and the MCP server API.
2.  [ ] **Type Safety:** Enforce strict TypeScript type safety across the entire backend.
3.  [ ] **Security:** Implement security best practices as outlined in `copilot.md` and `MCP_CONTEXT7_BEST_PRACTICES.md`.

---

**Phase 5: Frontend/UI**
1.  [ ] **Component Review:** Review and test all 778+ Svelte components to ensure they align with the architecture in `copilot.md`.
2.  [ ] **State Management:** Solidify the XState state machine implementation for chat and other complex UI components.
3.  [ ] **UI/UX:** Resolve any remaining UI/CSS errors and ensure a consistent user experience.

---

**Phase 6: Testing and Validation**
1.  [ ] **Unit Tests:** Write and run unit tests for all critical components, including the MCP server, Go microservices, and Svelte components.
2.  [ ] **Integration Tests:** Create integration tests for the entire system, ensuring all services work together correctly.
3.  [ ] **End-to-End Tests:** Run and update the Playwright end-to-end tests to cover all critical user flows.
4.  [ ] **Performance Profiling:** Profile the application and optimize performance bottlenecks.

---

**Phase 7: Advanced Systems Integration**
*   **Identity & Security:**
    *   [ ] Integrate Kratos for identity and user management.
    *   [ ] Secure the gRPC and QUIC communication channels.
*   **Observability & Monitoring:**
    *   [ ] Set up the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized logging.
    *   [ ] Integrate NATS for high-performance messaging between services.
*   **High-Performance Frontend:**
    *   [ ] Develop and integrate WebAssembly modules for performance-critical frontend tasks.
    *   [ ] Implement in-browser machine learning with Chrome ML (TensorFlow.js/ONNX).
    *   [ ] Design and build the "YoRHa" interface in SvelteKit 2.
*   **AI & Machine Learning:**
    *   [ ] Implement the WebGPU DAWN matrix processing pipeline with RabbitMQ for task queuing.
    *   [ ] Integrate `go-llama` with the GPU-accelerated Ollama instance.
    *   [ ] Develop the recommendation system using `langextract`, Google APIs, and `legal-bert`.
    *   [ ] Enhance the RAG system with a ranking mechanism to produce synthesized AI chat responses.
*   **Data & State Management:**
    *   [ ] Integrate Loki.js for client-side caching.
    *   [ ] Connect XState state machines to the Neo4j graph database.
    *   [ ] Implement the data flow between Neo4j and the JSONB data in PostgreSQL.
