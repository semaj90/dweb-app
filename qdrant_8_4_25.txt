Now let me create a simple Windows configuration and start Qdrant locally:



● Write(qdrant-local-config.yaml)

  ⎿  Wrote 1 lines to qdrant-local-config.yaml

     # Qdrant Local Configuration for Windows

     # Simplified configuration for local development

     service:

You'll be running the server in one terminal window, and then you'll use a second terminal window to run your application.

Step-by-Step Instructions:

Open Your Terminal

Open your terminal application (like Git Bash, which seems to be what the agent used, or the integrated terminal in VS Code).

Navigate to your project's root directory. If you're not already there, use the cd command:



Bash



cd /c/Users/james/Desktop/deeds-web/deeds-web-app

Run the Start Command

Paste the following command directly into your terminal and press Enter. This is the command that the agent successfully tested at the end of the log, but modified to start the server instead of just showing the help menu.



Bash



./qdrant-windows/qdrant.exe --config-path qdrant-local-config.yaml

Check the Output

The Qdrant server will now start running in this terminal window. You will not get your command prompt back.

You should see log output that looks something like this, confirming it's running using your config file:



[2025-08-04T19:40:30.123Z] INFO  actix_server::builder] Starting 8 workers

[2025-08-04T19:40:30.123Z] INFO  actix_server::server] Actix runtime found; starting in Actix runtime

...

[2025-08-04T19:40:30.567Z] INFO  qdrant::tonic_server] Qdrant gRPC server listening on 6334

[2025-08-04T19:40:30.567Z] INFO  qdrant::http_server] Qdrant HTTP server listening on 6333

The key lines are the last two, confirming the server is listening on ports 6333 (for HTTP API calls) and 6334 (for gRPC).

That's it! Qdrant is now running locally.

Important Next Steps:

Leave it Running: This terminal window is now the dedicated server process. Just minimize it, but don't close it.

Open a NEW Terminal: To run your SvelteKit application or any other commands, you must open a new, separate terminal window.

How to Stop Qdrant: When you are finished and want to shut the server down, go back to the first terminal window (the one running Qdrant) an

go microservice? + vite? 

       host: 127.0.0.1

       http_port: 6333

       grpc_port: 6334

       enable_cors: true

       max_request_size_mb: 64

       max_workers: 4



● Now let me create a script to start Qdrant locally:





● Let me try running it directly without the start command first to see if it works:



● Bash(timeout 10 ./qdrant-windows/qdrant.exe --config-path qdrant-local-config.yaml)

  ⎿  Error: _                 _

       __ _  __| |_ __ __ _ _ __ | |_

      / _` |/ _` | '__/ _` | '_ \| __|

     | (_| | (_| | | | (_| | | | | |_

      \__, |\__,_|_|  \__,_|_| |_|\__|

         |_|



     Version: 1.15.1, build: af7ab5b1

     Access web UI at http://localhost:6333/dashboard

● Bash(mkdir -p qdrant_storage && echo "Storage directory created")

     … +15 lines (ctrl+r to see all)



● Excellent! Qdrant started successfully. I can see it's running on:

  - HTTP: http://localhost:6333

  - gRPC: localhost:6334

  - Dashboard: http://localhost:6333/dashboard



  Now let me test the connection to verify it's working:



● Bash(curl -s http://localhost:6333/)

  ⎿  Running…
