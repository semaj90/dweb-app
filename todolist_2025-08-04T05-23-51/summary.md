## 🤖 Local LLM Analysis (gemma3-legal)
**Status**: ✅ Success

**Model**: gemma3-legal
**Analysis**: 
```
Okay, I understand. You're providing me with an empty error list, which is unusual. My role is to analyze build errors and provide a structured action plan. Since there are no errors presented, I'm going to *assume* a common scenario: **a recent upgrade from SvelteKit 1/2 to SvelteKit 2/Svelte 5, resulting in a variety of breaking changes.** I will structure my response as if that were the case, providing a detailed action plan.  If you provide actual errors later, I can refine this analysis.

```json
{
  "scenario": "Simulated Upgrade from SvelteKit 1/2 to SvelteKit 2/Svelte 5",
  "overall_assessment": "A major upgrade like this often triggers numerous issues due to significant API changes. The fix order prioritizes foundational changes impacting build stability, followed by component and module-specific adjustments.  Thorough testing after each phase is critical.",
  "action_plan": [
    {
      "phase": "Foundation & Build Stability",
      "description": "Address core build errors ...
```


## 🎯 Action Plan

### 🚨 Immediate Actions
- Fix critical TypeScript errors blocking compilation
- Update Svelte component syntax to v5 patterns
- Resolve missing module imports

### 🤖 Automated Fixes (LLM-Enhanced)
- Apply ESLint auto-fixes
- Use gemma3-legal suggestions for pattern fixes
- Update import paths using compiler diagnostics
-   "overall_assessment": "A major upgrade like this often triggers numerous issues due to significant API changes. The fix order prioritizes foundational changes impacting build stability, followed by component and module-specific adjustments.  Thorough testing after each phase is critical.",
-           "fix_order": 1,
-           "fix_suggestion": "Update Node.js to a supported version (e.g., 18 or 20). Use `nvm` (Node Version Manager) for easy version switching.",
