Since there are no errors presented, I'm going to *assume* a common scenario: **a recent upgrade from SvelteKit 1/2 to SvelteKit 2/Svelte 5, resulting in a variety of breaking changes.** I will structure my response as if that were the case, providing a detailed action plan.  If you provide actual errors later, I can refine this analysis.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scenario\": \"Simulated Upgrade from SvelteKit 1/2 to SvelteKit 2/Svelte 5\",\n  \"overall_assessment\": \"A major upgrade like this often triggers numerous issues due to significant API changes.
