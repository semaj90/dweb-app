  How to Run Tests:

  # Quick validation (recommended first)
  npm run test:quick

  # Start Ollama with GPU and run full test suite
  npm run test:full-stack

  # Run individual test categories
  npm run test:auth        # Authentication tests
  npm run test:store       # Global store tests  
  npm run test:health      # System health tests
  npm run test:sw          # Service worker tests
  npm run test:xstate      # XState machine tests
  npm run test:loki        # LokiJS caching tests
  npm run test:ingestion   # GPU Ollama ingestion tests

  # Run all comprehensive tests
  npm run test:comprehensive

  # View test report
  npm run test:report

  Key Test Coverage:

  ✅ User Authentication: Login, registration, session persistence, logout✅ Global Store: State
  synchronization, real-time updates, error handling✅ System Health: API monitoring, performance metrics,      
   error tracking✅ Service Workers: Offline mode, caching, background sync✅ XState Machines: Workflow
  states, transitions, error recovery✅ LokiJS Caching: Browser storage, cache optimization, offline
  data✅ GPU Ollama: GPU acceleration, model loading, ingestion pipeline✅ Logging Systems: Activity logs,       
   system diagnostics, audit trails

  Special Features Tested:

  - GPU Verification: CUDA availability, GPU vs CPU performance comparison
  - Ollama Integration: Model loading, embedding generation, chat functionality
  - Session Persistence: Cross-tab synchronization, browser refresh handling
  - Offline Capabilities: Service worker caching, data sync when online
  - Real-time Updates: WebSocket connections, live state updates
  - Error Recovery: Graceful degradation, retry mechanisms

  The test suite is designed to work with your existing stack and will automatically skip GPU tests if
  CUDA is not available. Run npm run test:quick first to validate everything is working, then use npm run      
  test:full-stack for the complete validation.

TL;DR: Practical Ways to Avoid Node.js Bottlenecks (on Windows 10 Home)
Concern	What to Do
Node is single-threaded	Use worker_threads, child_process, or offload to Rust/WASM
Memory issues	Use Node.js flags, monitor with clinic.js or Chrome DevTools
CPU-intensive operations	Offload to Rust (via NAPI or WebAssembly) or call native binaries
Real-time performance	Use Redis, RabbitMQ, or PostgreSQL LISTEN/NOTIFY
File watchers, polling	Use chokidar and set polling manually for Windows

✅ 1. Set Up a Stable Dev Environment
You're on Windows 10 Home + Node.js + VS Code 64-bit, so make sure:

✅ Node.js installed via https://nodejs.org

✅ Install Windows Build Tools (once):

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install --global windows-build-tools
✅ Install nvm-windows if you want multiple Node versions: https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows

✅ 2. Enable Worker Threads in Node.js
For anything CPU-bound (like tokenizing text, vector math, or langchain parsing), don't let the main Node.js thread do it.

Example using worker_threads:

ts
Copy
Edit
// worker.js
const { parentPort } = require('worker_threads');
parentPort.postMessage(doHeavyTask());

function doHeavyTask() {
  // ... tokenize embeddings or vector search
  return "done";
}
ts
Copy
Edit
// main.js
const { Worker } = require('worker_threads');
const worker = new Worker('./worker.js');
worker.on('message', msg => console.log('Worker says:', msg));
✅ Works in VS Code + Windows 10 Home

✅ 3. Use WebAssembly (WASM) for Heavy Lifting
Compile Rust or C to WASM, then use inside Node:

Example: Rust to WASM
Use wasm-pack:

bash
Copy
Edit
cargo install wasm-pack
cd my-rust-lib
wasm-pack build --target nodejs
In your Node.js:

ts
Copy
Edit
const wasm = require('./my-rust-lib/pkg');
console.log(wasm.my_heavy_fn());
🔥 Great for embedding comparison, cosine similarity, clustering, or anything heavy.

✅ 4. Prevent File Watcher Issues on Windows
On Windows, Node's file system watchers can crash or lag:

Use chokidar with polling:
ts
Copy
Edit
const chokidar = require('chokidar');

const watcher = chokidar.watch('./src', {
  usePolling: true,
  interval: 100,
});
watcher.on('change', (path) => console.log(`File changed: ${path}`));
✅ 5. Monitor Node.js Memory + CPU
Use:

A. Clinic.js (by NearForm)
bash
Copy
Edit
npm install -g clinic
clinic doctor -- node app.js
B. Chrome DevTools (Built-in)
bash
Copy
Edit
node --inspect app.js
Open chrome://inspect in Chrome → Inspect → Check memory/heap

✅ 6. Offload to Rust or C++ via Native Addons
If WebAssembly isn't enough and you want native speed with real threads, use node-ffi or napi-rs:

Example: N-API Rust Addon
https://github.com/napi-rs/napi-rs

✅ 7. Use Redis or RabbitMQ for Async Queues
Offload heavy async workflows:

ts
Copy
Edit
// Node producer
redis.lpush("my-queue", JSON.stringify({ user: "James" }));
ts
Copy
Edit
// Worker or microservice
redis.brpop("my-queue", 0, (err, data) => {
  processHeavyTask(JSON.parse(data[1]));
});
✅ 8. Replace Blocking Logic with Streaming
Example: don’t load big files into memory:

ts
Copy
Edit
fs.createReadStream('bigfile.txt')
  .pipe(process.stdout);
Or use async generators with LangChain + LLMs:

ts
Copy
Edit
for await (const chunk of llm.stream(prompt)) {
  process.stdout.write(chunk);
}
✅ 9. Compile Node with Flags for More Performance (Optional)
Try:

bash
Copy
Edit
node --max-old-space-size=4096 app.js
Or set .npmrc and .nvmrc with safe defaults.

✅ 10. Use ES Modules for Better Perf (Optional)
In your package.json:

json
Copy
Edit
"type": "module"
Use import and export instead of require.

✅ BONUS: VS Code Extensions for High Performance Debugging
💻 CodeLLDB — if using Rust + WASM

🔥 REST Client — test your APIs without leaving VS Code

🧠 Node.js Memory Usage — live chart + flamegraph

⚡ Thunder Client — fast API testing inside VS Code

🧩 Summary
Use Case	Fix / Tool
CPU-heavy logic	worker_threads, child_process, Rust/WASM
Memory issues	--max-old-space-size, clinic.js, Chrome tools
Blocking I/O	Streams, async iterators
Scaling / Realtime	Redis, RabbitMQ, Postgres LISTEN/NOTIFY
Native speed	napi-rs, wasm-pack, Rust binaries
Windows file issues	chokidar with polling

If you’d like, I can scaffold a high-performance Node.js backend using Rust + WASM, or add these optimizations to your existing SvelteKit 2 + Node stack.

Would you like:

A template with LangChain, Ollama, Qdrant, and Rust-WASM?

Or a .vscode/tasks.json setup with all these memory/debug flags baked in?
